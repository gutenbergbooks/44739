PREFACE.

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>mboldened by the popularity of the late entertainment, entitled
&ldquo;Cruikshank at Home,&rdquo; an Odd Candidate for fame now enters the lists.
</p>
<p>
The greatest care having been taken to render the subjects which have been
selected as interesting as possible, this Volume may safely be pronounced
even <i>more</i> attractive than either of its predecessors; and the
publisher has the additional pleasure of announcing that the Engravings
are the joint production of <i>two</i> clever artists&mdash;the one, Mr.
Cruikshank, a long-established favorite *&mdash;the other, Mr. Seymour, a
gentleman of far superior talent, but hitherto not quite, perhaps, so
extensively known, in consequence of his short residence in London.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* These designs were originally intended for a fourth volume
of &ldquo;Cruikshank at Home,&rdquo; but, in consequence of the late
disagreement between the two brothers Cruikshank (in
reference to the question, &ldquo;Which is the real Simon Pure?&rdquo;)
the projected title has been changed, and the work, by the
assistance of Mr. Seymour, metamorphosed into an &ldquo;Odd&rdquo;
 Volume.

<h2>
LEGEND OF THE LARGE MOUTH.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a large mouth indeed!&rdquo;
 Shakspeare&mdash;King John.
</pre>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>rriving one evening at an inn in Glasgow, I was shewn into a room which
already contained a promiscuous assemblage of travellers. Amongst the
rest, there was one whose features struck me as being the most horrible I
ever beheld. He was a large, pursy old man, with a head &ldquo;villainous low,&rdquo;
 hair like bell-ropes, eyes that were the smallest and most porkish of all
possible eyes, and a nose which shewed no more prominence <i>en profile</i>,
than that of the moon as exhibited in her first quarter upon a freemason&rsquo;s
apron; but all these monstrosities were as beauties&mdash;as lovelinesses&mdash;as
absolute perfections, compared with the mouth&mdash;the enormous mouth,
which, grinning beneath, formed a sort of rustic basement to the whole
superstructure of his facial horrors. This mouth&mdash;if mouth it might
be called, which had so little resemblance to the mouths of mankind&mdash;turned
full upon me as I entered; and, happening at the moment to be employed in
a yawn, actually seemed as if it would have willingly received me into its
prodigious crater, mumbled me to a mummy, and then bolted me, spurs and
all!
</p>
<p>
On sitting down, and proceeding to make myself acquainted with the rest of
the company, I discovered this monster to be a person of polite manners
and agreeable conversation. He spoke a good deal, and always in a lively
style. The best of him was, that he seemed quite at ease upon the subject
of his mouth. No doubt, he was conscious of his supernatural ugliness,&mdash;for,
whatever may be said of vanity and so forth, every person, male and
female, with unpleasant features, is so; but he had none of the boggling,
unsteady, un-complacent deportment, so remarkable in most of the persons
so circumstanced. On the contrary, there was an air of infinite
self-satisfaction about him, which told that he was either so familiar
with the dreadful fact as to mind it not; or that he was a man of the
world, above considering so trivial a particular; or that he was rich, and
could afford to be detested. His talk occasionally displayed considerable
humour, and even wit; but he never laughed at his own jokes. He evidently
dared not. Though his conversation, therefore, was exceedingly agreeable,
his deportment was rather grave. He never opened his whole mouth at once.
It was like a large car-riage-gate, with a wicket for the convenience of
foot-passengers. A small aperture, about the middle of it, sufficed for
the emission of his words. And, sometimes, he made an opening at either
flank to relieve guard upon the central hole, especially when he happened
to speak to some person sitting close by his side. Now and then, it closed
altogether, and looked (for it could look) forward into the fire, with an
appearance of pensive composure, as if speculating upon the red embers,
and auguring the duration of the black coal above.
</p>
<p>
As the time of supper drew nigh, I began to feel an intense anxiety about
the probable conduct of the mouth at table. How so extraordinary a
character would behave, what it would ask for, after what manner it would
masticate, and, above all, how much it would devour, were to me subjects
of the most interesting speculation. I thought of the proverb of my native
country, so ungracious to people with large mouths, and wondered if it
would be in this case belied or confirmed. Should the appetite, thought I,
be in proportion to the mouth, the scene will either be prodigiously
Horrible or highly amusing. But, perhaps, after all, this man is
misrepresented by his mouth; great eaters have been known to be little,
thin, shrivelled persons; while fat men have been supported, ere now, upon
two spare meals a-day: more would seem to depend upon the activity of the
internal machine, than upon its outward capacity. Who Knows but this man,
with all his corporeal size and large mouth, may turn out a perfect
example of abstemiousness? The question was one of deep concernment, and I
continued to consider it till it was announced that supper was ready. Upon
the mention of that interesting word, I observed the mouth suddenly bustle
up, and assume an air of promptitude, that seemed rather more favourable
to the proverb than I could have desired. The man rose, and, going to a
corner of the room where a number of portmanteaus lay heaped, selected and
brought forward one. He opened it with a deliberation that was
inexpressibly provoking, and, slowly turning up a few articles, at length
produced a parcel, wrapped in brown paper. This he laid down upon the
table, while I gazed on it with great and impatient curiosity, till the
owner as deliberately strapped up, locked, closed, and finally replaced
the portmanteau. He then took up the parcel, unfolded the paper, and took
out a large strange-looking spoon. The proverb, thought I, will stand yet,&mdash;the
spoon might have served in the nursery of Glumdalclitch.
</p>
<p>
It was a silver implement, of peculiar shape. The <i>calix</i> was
circular, like the spoons of the Romans, about four inches in diameter,
and one deep in the centre, altogether bearing some resemblance to an
ordinary saucer; and it had a short, sturdy handle with a whistle at the
extremity. Observing the attention of the company to be strongly directed
towards his spoon, the old man showed it round, with the most good-natured
politeness, telling us, that he had been so long accustomed to use this
goodly article at home, that, when he happened to travel, he was always
obliged to take it along with him, being unable to make such neat work of
his soup with the ordinary implements which he found abroad. &ldquo;But, indeed,
gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why should I make this a matter of delicacy with
you? The truth is, the spoon has a history, and my mouth&mdash;none of the
least, you see&mdash;has also a history. If you feel any curiosity upon
these points, I shall give you a biographical sketch of the one, and an
autobiographical sketch of the other, to amuse you till supper is ready.&rdquo;
 To this frank proposal all the company joyfully assented; and the old man
began a narrative, of which the following is the substance:&mdash;His
mouth was the chieftain and representative of a long ancestral line of
illustrious and most extensive mouths, which had flourished, for upwards
of two centuries, at a place called Tullibody, somewhere in the western
parts of Fife. There was a tradition, that the mouth originally came into
the family by marriage. Its introduction was a story of itself. A paternal
ancestor of the speaker, woo&rsquo;d, and was going to marry a lady of great
beauty, but no fortune, when his design was knocked on the head by the
interference of his father, who very kindly told him, one morning, that,
if he married that tocherless dame, he would cut him off with a shilling;
whereas, if he took to wife a certain lady of his appointment, he would be
so good as&mdash;not do that. The youth was somewhat staggered by his
father&rsquo;s declarations, and asked time to consider. The result was, that he
married the lady of his father&rsquo;s choice, who was the heiress to a large
fortune and a large mouth, both bequeathed to her by her father, one of
the celebrated kail-suppers of Fife. When this was told to the slighted
lady of his love, she was so highly offended, that she wished the mouth of
her fortunate rival might descend, in all its latitude, to the latest
generation of her faithless swain&rsquo;s posterity; and then took ill, and&mdash;married
another lover, her <i>second best</i>, next week, by way of revenge. The
country people, who pay great attention to the sayings and doings of
ladies condemned to wear the willow, waited anxiously for the fulfilment
of her malediction; and, accordingly shook their heads, and had their own
thoughts, when the kail-supper&rsquo;s daughter brought forth a son, with a
mouth reflecting back credit on her own. The triumph of the ill-wisher was
considered complete, when the second, and third, and all the other
children, were found to be equally distinguished by this feature; and,
what gave the triumph still more piquancy, was, that the daughters were
found to be no more excepted than the sons from the family doom. In the
second generation, moreover, instead of being softened or diluted away,
the mouth rather increased; and so it had done in every successive
generation since that time. The race having been very prolific, it was now
spread so much, that there was scarcely a face in Tullibody altogether
free of the contagion: the people there had almost ceased to regard a
large mouth as a joke: it was so common as not to be noted; or there were
so many, that there was not one mouth to laugh at another.
</p>
<p>
Fate and fortune are said to be very favourable to people with large
mouths. So it proved in this case. After the mouth came into the family,
luck also came; and still as the mouth had increased with successive
generations, just so had riches increased. The third in line from the
&ldquo;first man,&rdquo; a cooper by profession, became so wealthy before he died,
that he might have got his name handed down to immortality on a certain
conspicuous, though dusty and illegible, board in the parish church, along
with those of other charitable persons by leaving &ldquo;ane hunder merks Scots
to ye pvir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Despising the humble glory of making such a legacy, and being too poor to
found a college, and too wise to endow a cat, he did better; he <i>founded
a spoon</i>&mdash;a spoon which should go down to future ages as a
traditionary joke upon his family-feature, and remain for ever in the
hands of those who could appreciate his beneficence. He left it under
certain provisions, or statutes of foundation. The main scope of his
intentions, was, simply, that the spoon should always be possessed by his
largest-mouthed descendant. In the first place, after his own death it was
to fall into the hands of his eldest son, a youth of highly promising
mouth; or, indeed, whose mouth was fully entitled to the proverbial praise
bestowed upon the cooper of Fogo,&mdash;&ldquo;that it was his father&rsquo;s equal
and mair,&rdquo; and who moreover, entertained such a respect for the will of
his parent, that he seemed likely to preserve and transmit the precious
heir-loom with all due zeal and care. At his death, it was to become the
property of the son, daughter, nephew, or niece (for it was not limited <i>heredibus
masculis</i>, but, with laudable regard for the claims of the fairer sex,
destined <i>heredibus quibuscunque</i>), who should appear to him, judging
conscientiously, and in his right mind, to have the mouth most fitted to
enjoy it in all its latitude. At the death of that person, it was to go to
the next largest mouth (<i>isto vel ista, judice</i>), and so on, in all
time coming. After passing the second generation, of course uncles,
cousins, and grand-nephews, might become eligible, provided that the
family should spread itself out into these relationships; but, <i>quibus
deficientibus</i>, the nearest of kin and largest of mouth whatsoever, so
that they were of the name, might come in as competitors, the same being
always subject to the review and choice of the former possessor. In the
case of any possessor being cut off suddenly, without appointing a
successor to his trust, then the affair was to be decided by a popular
election.
</p>
<p>
It may seem a strange though a liberal and even gallant thing, in the
founder of the spoon, that he should have considered the females of his
posterity in the statutes, seeing that, according to the ordinary rule of
human nature, there was little chance of their ever being found to excel
the males in point of mouth. Yet this was a very proper and well-judged
article. The truth is, that, as the feature had originally come into the
family by a lady, so had it always continued to distinguish the daughters,
to an equal, if not superior, degree with the sons. Indeed, the wisdom of
the statute was put beyond a doubt, by the circumstance of a daughter
having actually been, upon one occasion (nearly a century ago), the
possessor of the spoon! And this circumstance was the more remarkable on
the following account:&mdash;This lady, when her mouth was brought to its
last speech, attempted to bequeath the valuable heir-loom to her second,
and favourite, and largest-mouthed son&mdash;a person, of course, not
eligible, on account of his being only the <i>half-blood</i>, and wanting
the necessary name By this infraction of the statute, the spoon might have
fallen into the possession of a new family altogether, and probably never
again reverted to any one of the name and mouth of the founder. It is
true, the articles were somewhat defective upon this point, and the
question might have stood a discussion before the Fifteen. Yet the thing
looked at least against the <i>spirit</i> of the founder&rsquo;s intentions and,
any how, the male heirs determined, at all hazards, to oppose her will.
Having come to this resolution at a general meeting, they forthwith
marched <i>in posse</i> to the bed of their dying relative; and there
after lecturing her for some time upon the heinousness of her intentions&mdash;which
they did <i>cum oribus</i>, not only <i>rotundis</i>, but also both <i>longis
et latis, imo etiam perlatis</i>, as Dominie Sampson would have said&mdash;they
demanded the spoon, which they said, she had fairly forfeited by her
misconduct, one of the statutes containing the clause <i>ad vitam aut
culpam</i>. The sons of the dying lady proposed to dispute the point: but
she told them, that, as she repented of her fault, she would endeavour to
repair it, before time and she should part for ever, by surrendering the
spoon of her ancestors to its just and lawful claimants; and this she
forthwith did. The large-mouthed host then went away satisfied, and
proceeded to adjudge it by votes to one of two or three persons of the
true blood, who entered as candidates for the highly-prized trust.
</p>
<p>
After the election, the whole clan entered into a paction, whereby they
bound themselves and their posterity to take similar measures in case of
the same exigency recurring. They might, however, have spared themselves
this trouble, and left posterity free to act as it thought proper; for,
thenceforward (fate seeming to take so important a matter into her own
hand), to the surprise and satisfaction of the family, the daughters began
to be born with less, and the sons with larger mouths than formerly; so
that, though the law of <i>Tanistry</i> * still prevailed, that entitled
the <i>Salique</i> came into full force, as it were, of its own accord;
and no instance had occurred, for a century past, of any female, married
or unmarried, becoming so much as a competitor for the invaluable vessel,
which now glided peacefully down the current of ages, in the possession of
a lineal male line of truly respectable mouths, prized by the happy
inheritors, and honoured by the homage and veneration of all the rest of
the family. **
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The phrase applicable to the succession of uncles and
nephews, in preference to sons, customary in the early ages
of the Scottish monarchy.

** Since this story was first printed, the author has been
informed of another similar heir-loom which belonged to the
family of Crawfurd of Crawfurdland, in Ayrshire (now extinct
in the male line), and which bore the following
inscription:&mdash;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
This spoune I leave for a legacie
To the muckle-mou&rsquo;d Crawfurds after me.
</pre>
<p>
Just as the old gentleman concluded his narrative, supper was introduced,
and we all rose, in order to re-arrange ourselves round the table. I now
knew the history of his mouth and spoon; but I was still ignorant of the
extent of his appetite. The confessions of the Mouth had been ample and
explicit; but it had been silent as the grave, which it resembled, upon
the corresponding matter of the stomach. My anxiety upon this point was
excessive&mdash;was painful&mdash;was intolerable. I did not know what to
expect of it. Ere we sat down, I cast towards it a look of awful
curiosity. It was hovering like a prodigious rainbow over the horizon of
the table, uncertain where to pitch itself&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Avi similis, quae circum litora, circum
Piscosos scopulos,&mdash;&mdash;- volat&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
There was an air of terrible resolution about it, which made me almost
tremble for what was to ensue. Still I hoped the best; and I, at last, sat
down, with the resigned idea that time would try all.
</p>
<p>
The Mouth&mdash;for so it might be termed <i>par excellence</i>&mdash;was
preferred by acclamation to the head of the table,&mdash;a distinction
awarded, as I afterwards understood (<i>secundum morem bagman</i>), not so
much on account of its superior greatness, as in consideration of its
seniority, though I am sure it deserved the <i>pas</i> on both accounts.
The inferior and junior mouths all sat down at different distances from
the great mouth, like satellites round a mighty planet. It uttered a short
gentleman-like grace, and then began to ask its neighbours what they would
have. Some asked for one thing, some for another, and in a short time all
were served except itself For its own part, it complained of weak
appetite, and expressed a fear that it should not be able to take anything
at all. I could scarcely credit the declaration. It added, in a singularly
prim tone of voice, that, for its part, it admired the taste of Beau Tibbs
in Goldsmith,&mdash;&ldquo;Something nice, and a little will do,&mdash;I hate
your immense loads of meat; that&rsquo;s country all over!&rdquo; Hereupon I plucked
up courage, and ventured to look at it again. It was still terrible,
though placid. Its expression was that of a fresh and strong warrior, who
hesitates a moment to consider into what part of a thick battle he shall
plunge himself, or what foes he shall select as worthy of particular
attack. Its look belied its words; but again I was thrown back by its
words belying its look. It said to a neighbour of mine, that it thought it
might perhaps manage the half of the tail of one of the herrings at his
elbow, if he would be so kind as carve. Was there ever such a puzzling
mouth! I was obliged again to give credit to words; yet again was I
disappointed. My neighbour, thinking it absurd to mince such a matter as a
herring, handed up a whole one to the chairman. The mouth received it,
with a torrent of refusals and remonstrances, in the midst of which it
began to eat, and I heard it continue to mumble forth expostulations, in a
fainter and fainter tone, at the intervals of bites, for a few seconds,
till behold, the whole corporate substance of the fish had melted away to
a long meager skeleton! When done, its remonstrances changed into a wonder
how it should have got through so plump a fish&mdash;it was perfectly
astonishing&mdash;it had never eaten a whole herring in its life before&mdash;it
was an unaccountable miracle. I did not hear the latter sentences of its
wonderments; but, towards the conclusion, heard the word &ldquo;fowl&rdquo; distinctly
pronounced. The fowls lying to my hand, I found myself under the necessity
of entering into conference with it, though I felt a mortal disinclination
to look it in the mouth, lest I should betray some symptom of emotion
inconsistent with good manners. Drawing down my features into a resolute
pucker, and mentally vowing I would speak to it, though it should blast
me, I cast my eyes slowly and cautiously towards it, and made inquiry as
to its choice of bits. In return for my interrogation, I received a polite
convulsion, intended for a smile, and a request, out of which I only
caught the important words &ldquo;breast&rdquo; and &ldquo;wing.&rdquo; I made haste to execute
the order; and, on handing away the desired viands, received from the
Mouth another grateful convulsion; and then&mdash;thank God, all was over!
Well, thought I, at this juncture, a herring and fragment of fowl are no
such great matters; perhaps the Mouth will prove quite a natural mouth,
after all. In brief space, however, the chairman&rsquo;s plate was announced as
again empty; and, I heard it receive, discuss, and answer various
proposals of replenishment made to it by its more immediate neighbours. I
thought I would escape; but no,&mdash;&ldquo;the fowl was really so good, that
it thought it would trouble me for another breast, if I would be so kind,&rdquo;
 &amp;c. I was, of course, obliged to look at it again, in order to receive
its request in proper form; and, <i>oh, me miserum</i>; neglecting this
time my former preparations of face, I had nearly committed myself by
looking it full in the mouth, with my eyes wide open, and without having
screwed my facial muscles into their former resolute astringency. However,
instantly apprehending the amount of its demands, my glance at the Mouth
fortunately required to be only momentary, and I found immediate relief
from all danger in the ensuing business of carving. Yet even that glance
was in itself a dreadful trial; it sufficed to inform me, that the Mouth
was now more terrible than before \ that there was a fearful vivacity
about it&mdash;a promptitude&mdash;an alacrity&mdash;an energy&mdash;which
it did not formerly exhibit. Should this increase, thought I, it will soon
be truly dreadful. I handed up a whole fowl to it, in a sort of
desperation. It made no remonstrances, as in the case of the herring, at
the abundance of my offering. So far from that, it seemed to forgive my
disobedience with the utmost good will; received the fowl, and despatched
it with silence and celerity, and then again looked abroad for farther
prey. Indeed, it now began to crack jokes upon itself,&mdash;a sportive
species of suicide. It spoke of the spoon; lamented that, after all, there
should be no soups at table, whereon it might have exhibited itself; and
finally vowed, that it would visit the deficiences of the supper upon the
dessert, even unto the third and fourth dish of <i>Blanc-mange</i>. The
proprietor of the Mouth then laid down the spoon upon the table, there to
lie in readiness, till such time as he should find knives and forks of no
farther service&mdash;as the Scottish soldiery, in former times used to
lay their shields upon the ground while making use of their spears. I now
gave up all hopes of the Mouth observing any propriety in its future
transactions. But, having finished my own supper, I resolved to set myself
down to observe all its sayings and doings, without giving myself any
farther concern about the proverb, which I was formerly so solicitous that
it should not fulfil. Its placidity was now gone&mdash;its air of
self-possession lost. New powers seemed to be every moment developing
themselves throughout its vast form&mdash;new and more terrible powers. It
was beginning to have a <i>wild look!</i> It was evident that it was now
<i>fleshed</i>&mdash;that its naturally savage disposition, formerly
dormant for want of excitement, was now rising tumultuously within it&mdash;that
it would soon perform such deeds as would scare us all! It had engaged
itself, before I commenced my observations, upon a roast jigot of mutton,
which happened to lie near it. This it soon nearly finished. It then cast
a look of fearful omen at a piece of cold beef, which lay immediately
beyond it, and which, being placed within reach by some kind neighbour it
immediately commenced upon, with as much fierceness as it had just
exemplified in the case of the mutton. The beef also was soon laid waste,
and another look of extermination was forthwith cast at a broken
pigeon-pie, which lay still farther off. Hereupon the eye had scarcely
alighted, when the man nearest it, with laudable promptitude, handed it
upwards. Scarcely was it laid on the altar of destruction, when it
disappeared too; and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth look, were
successively cast at other dishes, which the different members of the
party* as promptly sent away, and which the Mouth as promptly despatched.
By this time, all the rest of the party were lying upon their oars,
observing, with leisurely astonishment, the progress of the surviving,
and, as it appeared to them, eternal feeder. <i>He</i> went on, rejoicing
in his strength, unheeding their idleness and wonder, his very soul
apparently engrossed in the grand business of devouring. They seemed to
enter into a sort of tacit compact, or agreement, to indulge and
facilitate him in his progress, by making themselves, as it were, his
servitors. Whatever dish he looked at, therefore, over the wide expanse of
the table, immediately disappeared from its place. One after another, they
trooped off towards the head of the table, like the successive brigades
which Wellington despatched at Waterloo, against a particular field of
French artillery; and, still, dish after dish, like the said brigades,
came successively away, broken, shattered, diminished. Fish, flesh, and
fowl, disappeared at the glance of that awful eye, as the Roman fleet
withered and vanished before the grand burning glass of Archimedes. The
end of all things seemed at hand! The Mouth was arrived at a perfect
transport of voracity! It seemed to be no more capable of restraining
itself than some great engine, full of tremendous machinery, which cannot
stop of itself. It had no self-will. It was an unaccountable being. It was
a separate creature, independent of the soul. It was not a human thing at
all. It was every thing that was superhuman&mdash;every thing that was
immense&mdash;inconceivably enormous! All objects seemed reeling and
toppling on towards it, like the foam-bells upon a mighty current,
floating silently on towards the orifice of some prodigious sea-cave. It
was like the whirlpool of Maelstrom, every thing that comes within the
vortex of which, for miles round, is sure of being caught, inextricably
involved, whirled round, and round, and round, and then down, down that
monstrous gulf&mdash;that mouth of the mighty ocean, the lips of which are
overwhelming waves, whose teeth are prodigious rocks, and whose belly is
the great abyss!
</p>
<p>
Here I grew dizzy, fainted, and&mdash;I never saw the Mouth again.

<h2>
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ail to thee, loveliest June! Thy smile awaited me at my birth; may it
rest upon me at the hour of death&mdash;may it cast its sunshine into my
grave as my coffin descends into the earth, and the few who loved me look
upon it for the last time!
</p>
<p>
The fruits&mdash;the luscious ruby fruits&mdash;are swelling into
ripeness. I know nothing of the fruits of the south&mdash;I talk of those
of my own country. I have a thorough contempt for Italy with its grapes!&mdash;I
detest Spain with its oranges!&mdash;I should be happy to annihilate
Turkey and Asia with their olives and citrons!&mdash;I am writing and
thinking only of England. I was a child once;&mdash;Reader! so were you.
Do you recollect the day and the hour when the blessed influence of
strawberries and cream first flashed on your awakened mind, and you felt
that life had not been given you in vain? I was just seven years old&mdash;my
previous existence is a blank in memory&mdash;when I spent a June in the
country.
</p>
<p>
I may have picked before in the blind ignorance of infancy, some little
red pulpy balls, which may have been presented to me on a little blue
plate by my aunt or grandmother&mdash;but never&mdash;never till my
seventh year was I aware that in the melting luxuriance of one mouthful,
so large a share of human happiness might be comprised. Sugar, cream, and
strawberries! Epicurean compound of unimaginable ecstasy! trinity of
excellence! producing the only harmonious whole known to me in all the
annals of taste! The fresh vigour of my youthful palate may have yielded
somewhat to the deadening effect of time, but the glorious recollections
of those profound emotions, excited by my first intoxicating feast on
strawberries and cream, is worth every other thought that memory can
conjure up. Breathes there the man who presumes to smile at my enthusiasm?
Believe me, he is destined to pass away and be forgotten, as the insect
upon which you tread. He is a measurer of broad-cloth or a scribbler of
juridical technicalities.
</p>
<p>
Such is not the destiny awaiting yonder rosy group of smiling prattlers. I
love the rogues for the enlarged and animated countenances with which they
gaze upon the red spoils before them. Never speak to me of gluttony. It is
a natural and a noble appetite, redolent of health and happiness, and I
honour it. There is genius in the breathing expression of those parted
lips which, now that the good dame is about to commence her impartial
division, seem to anticipate, in a delightful agony of expectation, the
fulness of coming joy. Observe with how much vigour that youthful Homer
grasps his silver spoon! Would you have thought those rose-bud lips could
have admitted so vast a mouthful of strawberries?&mdash;Yet, down they go
that juvenile oesophagus, and, as Shakspeare well expresses it, &ldquo;leave not
a wreck behind!&rdquo; Turn your gaze to this infantine Sappho. What unknown
quantities of cream and sugar the little cherub consumes!&mdash;Cold on
the stomach! Pho! the idea is worthy of a female Septuagenarian, doomed to
the horrors of perpetual celibacy. If she speak from experience, in
heaven&rsquo;s name, give her a glass of brandy, and let her work out her
miserable existence in fear and trembling.
</p>
<p>
If there be a merrier party of bon-vivants at this moment in Christendom,
may I never enter a garden again! Yet, at this very moment, there are
prime ministers sitting down to cabinet dinners, and seeing in every guest
another step in the ladder of ambition; at this very moment, the table of
the professional epicure is covered with all that is <i>recherché</i> in
the annals of gastronomy; at this very moment, the bride of yesternight
takes her place of honour, for the first time, at the table of her rich
and titled husband. Alas! there are traitors at the statesman&rsquo;s board;
there is poison and disease within the silver dishes of the epicure; and
there are silent but sad memories of days past away for ever, strewed like
withered flowers round the heart of the young bride! But before you is a
living garland, still blooming, unconscious of the thousand cankers of
earth and air.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, I am not sure that strawberries ought to be eaten when any
one is with you. There is always under such circumstances, even though
your companion be the dearest friend you have on earth, a feeling of
restraint, a consciousness that your attention is divided, a diffidence
about betraying the unfathomable depth of your love for the fruit before
you, a lurking uneasiness lest he should eat faster than yourself, or
appropriate an undue share of the delicious cream; in short there is
always, on such occasions, a secret desire that the best friend you have
in the world were at any distant part of the globe he might happen to have
a liking for. But, oh! the bliss of solitary fruition, when there is none
to interrupt you&mdash;none to compete with you&mdash;none to express
stupid amazement at the extent of your godlike appetite, or to bring back
your thoughts, by some obtrusive remark, to the vulgar affairs of an
unsubstantial world!&mdash;Behold! the milky nectar is crimsoned by the
roseate fruit! Heavens! what a flavour! and there is not another human
being near to intrude upon the sacred intensity of your joy! Painter&mdash;poet&mdash;philosopher&mdash;where
is your beau-ideal&mdash;happiness? It is concentrated there&mdash;and,
divided into equal portions by that silver spoon, glides gloriously down
the throat! Eat, child of mortality! for June cometh but once in the year!
eat, for there is yet misery in store for thee! eat, for thy days are
numbered! eat, as if thou wert eating immortal life!&mdash;eat, eat,
though thy next mouthful terminate in apoplexy!
</p>
<p>
My dream of strawberries hath passed away! the little red rotundities have
been gathered from the surface of the globe, and man&rsquo;s insatiate maw has
devoured them all! New hopes may arise, and new sources of pleasure may
perhaps be discovered;&mdash;the yellow gooseberry may glitter like amber
beads upon the bending branches&mdash;the ruby cherry may be plucked from
the living bough, and its sunny sides bruised into nectar by the willing
teeth&mdash;the apple, tinted with the vermillion bloom of maiden beauty,
may woo the eye, and tempt the silver knife&mdash;the golden pear melting
into lusciousness, soft as the lip, and sweet as the breath of her thou
lovest most, may win, for a time, thy heart&rsquo;s idolatry&mdash;the velvet
peach, or downy apricot, may lull thee into brief forgetfulness of all
terrestrial woe&mdash;the dark-blue plum, or sunbeam coloured <i>magnum
bonum</i>, may waft thy soul to heaven&mdash;or, last of all, thy
hot-house grapes, purple on their bursting richness, may carry thee back
to the world&rsquo;s prime, to the fawn and dryad-haunted groves of Arcady, or
lap thee in an elysium of poetry and music&mdash;but still the remembrance
of thy first love will be strong in thy heart, and, pamper thy noble
nature as thou wilt, with all the luxuries that summer yields, never,
never, will the innermost recesses of thy soul cease to be inhabited by an
immortal reminiscence of &ldquo;Strawberries and Cream!&rdquo;

<h2>
THE ROSE IN JANUARY.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had the good fortune to become acquainted, in his old age, with the
celebrated Wieland, and to be often admitted to his table. It was there
that, animated by a flask of Rhenish, he loved to recount the anecdotes of
his youth, and with a gaiety and <i>naivete</i> which rendered them
extremely interesting. His age&mdash;his learning&mdash;his celebrity&mdash;no
longer threw us to a distance, and we laughed with him as joyously as he
himself laughed in relating the little adventure which I now attempt to
relate. It had a chief influence on his life, and it was that which he was
fondest of retracing, and retraced with most poignancy. I can well
remember his very words; but there are still wanting the expression of his
fine countenance&mdash;his hair white as snow, gracefully curling round
his head&mdash;his blue eyes, somewhat faded by years, yet still
announcing his genius and depth of thought; his brow touched with the
lines of reflection, but open, elevated, and of a distinguished character;
his smile full of benevolence and candour. &ldquo;I was handsome enough,&rdquo; he
used sometimes to say to us&mdash;and no one who looked at him could doubt
it: &ldquo;but I was not amiable, for a <i>savant</i> rarely is,&rdquo; he would add
laughingly,&mdash;and this every one doubted; so to prove it, he recounted
the little history that follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was not quite thirty,&rdquo; said he to us, &ldquo;when I obtained the chair of
philosophical professor in this college, in the most flattering manner: I
need not tell you that my <i>amour propre</i> was gratified by a
distinction rare enough at my age. I certainly had worked for it formerly:
but at the moment it came to me, another species of philosophy occupied me
much more deeply, and I would have given more to know what passed in one
heart, than to have had power to analyze those of all mankind. I was
passionately in love; and you all know, I hope, that when love takes
possession of a young head, adieu to every thing else; there is no room
for any other thought. My table was covered with folios of all colours,
quires of paper of all sizes, journals of all species, catalogues of
books, in short, of all that one finds on a professor&rsquo;s table: but of the
whole circle of science, I had for some time studied only the article <i>Rose</i>,
whether in the Encyclopaedia, the botanical books, or all the gardeners&rsquo; 
calendars that I could meet with. You shall learn presently what led me to
this study, and why it was that my window was always open, even during the
coldest days. All this was connected with the passion by which I was
possessed, and which was become my sole and continual thought. I could not
well say at this moment how my lectures and courses got on; but this I
know, that more than once I have said, &lsquo;Amelia,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;philosophy.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the name of my beauty&mdash;in fact, of the beauty of the
University, Mademoiselle de Belmont. Her father, a distinguished officer,
had died on the field of battle. She occupied with her mother a large and
handsome house in the street in which I lived, on the same side, and a few
doors distant. This mother, wise and prudent, obliged by circumstances to
inhabit a city filled with young students from all parts, and having so
charming a daughter, never suffered her a moment from her sight, either in
or out of doors. But the good lady passionately loved company and cards;
and to reconcile her tastes with her duties, she carried Amelia with her
to all the assemblies of dowagers, professors&rsquo; wives, canonesses, &amp;c.
&amp;c., where the poor girl <i>ennuyed</i> herself to death with hemming
or knitting beside her mother&rsquo;s card-table. But you ought to have been
informed, that no student, indeed no man under fifty, was admitted. I had
then but little chance of conveying my sentiments to Amelia. I am sure,
however, that any other than myself would have discovered this chance, but
I was a perfect novice in gallantry; and until the moment when I imbibed
this passion from Amelia&rsquo;s beautiful dark eyes, mine, having been always
fixed upon Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, &amp;c., understood nothing at
all of the language of the heart. It was at an old lady&rsquo;s, to whom I was
introduced, that I became acquainted with Amelia; my destiny led me to her
house on the evening of her assembly; she received me&mdash;I saw
Mademoiselle de Belmont, and from that instant her image was engraven in
lines of fire on my heart. The mother frowned at the sight of a
well-looking young man: but my timid, grave, and perhaps somewhat pedantic
air, re-assured her. There were a few other young persons&mdash;daughters
and nieces of the lady of the mansion; it was summer&mdash;they obtained
permission to walk in the garden, under the windows of the saloon, and the
eyes of their mammas. I followed them; and, without daring to address a
word to my fair one, caught each that fell from her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Her conversation appeared to me as charming as her person; she spoke on
different subjects with intelligence above her years. In making some
pleasant remarks on the defects of men in general, she observed, that
‘what she most dreaded was violence of temper.&rsquo; Naturally of a calm
disposition, I was wishing to boast of it; but not having the courage, I
at last entered into her idea, and said so much against passion, that I
could not well be suspected of an inclination to it. I was recompensed by
an approving smile; it emboldened me, and I began to talk much better than
I thought myself capable of doing before so many handsome women; she
appeared to listen with pleasure; but when they came to the chapter of
fashions, I had no more to say&mdash;it was an unknown language; neither
did she appear versed in it. Then succeeded observations on the flowers in
the garden; I knew little more of this than of the fashions, but I might
likewise have my particular taste; and to decide, I waited to learn that
of Amelia: she declared for the <i>Rose</i>, and grew animated in the
eulogy of her chosen flower. From that moment, it became for me the queen
of flowers. &lsquo;Amelia,&rsquo; said a pretty, little, laughing, <i>Espiègle</i>,
‘how many of your favourites are condemned to death this winter?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
one! replied she; &lsquo;I renounce them&mdash;their education is too
troublesome, and too ungrateful a task; and I begin to think I know
nothing about it.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I assumed sufficient resolution to ask the explanation of this question
and answer. She gave it to me. &lsquo;You have just learned that I am
passionately fond of roses: it is an hereditary taste: my mother is still
fonder of them than I am; since I was able to think of any thing, I have
had the greatest wish to offer her a rose-tree in blow (as a new year&rsquo;s
gift) on the first of January; I have never succeeded. Every year I have
put a quantity of rose-trees into vases; the greater number perished; and
I have never been able to offer one rose to my mother.&rsquo; So little did I
know of the culture of flowers, as to be perfectly ignorant that it was
possible to have roses in winter; but from the moment that I understood
that it might be, without a miracle, and that incessant attention only was
necessary, I promised myself, that this year the first of January should
not pass without Amelia&rsquo;s offering her mother a rose tree in blow. We
returned to the saloon&mdash;so close was I on the watch, that I heard her
ask my name in a whisper. Her companion answered, &lsquo;I know him only by
reputation; they say he is an author; and so learned, that he is already a
professor.&rsquo; &lsquo;I should never have guessed it,&rsquo; said Amelia; &lsquo;he seems
neither vain nor pedantic.&rsquo; How thankful was I for this reputation.&mdash;Next
morning I went to a gardener, and ordered fifty rose-trees, of different
months, to be put in vases. &lsquo;It must be singular ill fortune,&rsquo; thought I,
‘if, among this number, one at least does not flower.&rsquo; On leaving the
gardener, I went to my bookseller&rsquo;s&mdash;purchased some works on flowers,
and returned home full of hope. I intended to accompany my rose-tree with
a fine letter, in which I should request to visit Madame de Belmont, in
order to teach her daughter the art of having roses in winter; the
agreeable lesson, and the charming scholar, were to me much pleasanter
themes than those of my philosophical lectures. I built on all this the
prettiest romance possible; my milk-pail had not yet got on so far as <i>Perrettes</i>;
she held it on her head; and my rose was not yet transplanted into its
vase; but I saw it all in blow. In the mean time, I was happy only in
imagination; I no longer saw Amelia; they ceased to invite me to the
dowager parties, and she was not allowed to mix in those of young people.
I must then be restricted, until my introducer was in a state of
presentation, to seeing her every evening pass by with her mother, as they
went to their parties. Happily for me, Madame de Belmont was such a coward
in a carriage, that she preferred walking when it was possible. I knew the
hour at which they were in the habit of leaving home; I learned to
distinguish the sound of the bell of their gate from that of all the
others of the quarter; my window on the floor was always open; at the
moment I heard their gate unclose, I snatched up some volume, which was
often turned upside down, stationed myself at the window, as if profoundly
occupied with my study, and thus almost every day saw for an instant the
lovely girl; and this instant was sufficient to attach me to her still
more deeply. The elegant simplicity of her dress; her rich dark hair
wreathed round her head, and falling in ringlets on her forehead; her
slight and graceful figure&mdash;her step at once light and commanding&mdash;the
fairy foot, that the care of guarding the snowy robe rendered visible,
inflamed my admiration; while her dignified and composed manner, her
attention to her mother, and the affability with which she saluted her
inferiors, touched my heart yet more. I began too, to fancy, that, limited
as were my opportunities of attracting her notice, I was not entirely
indifferent to her. For example, on leaving home, she usually crossed to
the opposite side of the street; for had she passed close to my windows,
she guessed, that, intently occupied as I chose to appear, I could not
well raise my eyes from my book; then, as she came near my house, there
was always something to say, in rather a louder tone, as, &lsquo;Take care
mamma; lean heavier on me; do you feel cold?&rsquo; I then raised my eyes,
looked at her, saluted her, and generally encountered the transient glance
of my divinity, who, with a blush, lowered her eyes, and returned my
salute. The mother, all enveloped in cloaks, and hoods, saw nothing. I saw
every thing&mdash;and surrendered my heart. A slight circumstance
augmented my hopes. I had published &lsquo;An Abridgement of Practical
Philosophy.&rsquo; It was an extract from my course of lectures&mdash;was
successful, and the edition was sold. My bookseller, aware that I had some
copies remaining, came to beg one for a customer of his, who was extremely
anxious to get it; and he named Mademoiselle Amelia Belmont. I actually
blushed with pleasure; to conceal my embarrassment, I laughingly inquired,
what could a girl of her age want with so serious a work? &lsquo;To read it,
sir, doubtless;&rsquo; replied the bookseller; &lsquo;Mademoiselle Amelia does not
resemble the generality of young ladies; she prefers useful to amusing
books.&rsquo; He then mentioned the names of several that he had lately sent to
her; and gave me a high opinion of her taste. &lsquo;From her impatience for
your book,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;I can answer for it, that it will be perused with
great pleasure; more than ten messages have been sent; at last I promised
it for to-morrow, and I beg of you to enable me to keep my word.&rsquo; I
thrilled with joy, as I gave him the volumes, at the idea that Amelia
would read my sentiments, and that she would learn to know me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;October arrived, and with it my fifty vases of rose-trees; for which of
course, they made me pay what they chose;&mdash;and I was as delighted to
count them in my room, as a miser would his sacks of gold. They all looked
rather languishing, but then it was because they had not yet reconciled
themselves to the new earth. I read all that was ever written on the
culture of roses, with much more attention than I had formerly read my old
philosophers; and I ended as wise as I began. I perceived that this
science, like all others has no fixed rules, and that each vaunts his
system, and believes it the best. One of my gardener authors would have
the rose-trees as much as possible in the open air; another recommended
their being kept close shut up; one ordered constant watering; another
absolutely forbade it. &lsquo;It is thus with the education of man,&rsquo; said I,
closing the volumes in vexation. &lsquo;Always in extremes&mdash;let us try the
medium between these opposite opinions.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I established a good thermometer in my room; and, according to its
indications, I put them outside the windows or took them in; you may guess
that fifty vases, to which I gave this exercise three or four times a-day,
according to the variations of the atmosphere, did not leave me much idle
time; and this was the occupation of a professor of philosophy! Ah! well
might they have taken his chair from him, and sent him back to school, a
thousand times more childish than the youngest of those pupils to whom I
hurried over the customary routine of philosophical lessons: my whole mind
was fixed on Amelia and my rose trees.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The death of the greater number of my <i>eleves</i>, however, soon
lightened my labour; more than half of them never struck root I flung them
into the fire; a fourth part of those that remained, after unfolding some
little leaves, stopped there. Several assumed a blackish yellow tint, and
gave me hopes of beautifying; some flourished surprisingly, but only in
leaves; others, to my great joy, were covered with buds; but in a few days
they always got that little yellow circle which gardeners call the collar,
and which is to them a mortal malady&mdash;their stalks twisted&mdash;they
drooped&mdash;and finally fell, one after the other, to the earth&mdash;not
a single bud remaining on my poor trees. This withered my hopes; and the
more care I took of my invalids&mdash;the more I hawked them from window
to window, the worse they grew. At last one of them, and but one, promised
to reward my trouble&mdash;thickly covered with leaves, it formed a
handsome bush, from the middle of which sprung out a fine vigorous branch,
crowned with six beautiful buds that got no collar&mdash;grew, enlarged,
and even discovered, through their calices, a slight rose tint. There were
still six long weeks before the new year; and certainly four, at least, of
my precious buds would be blown by that time. Behold me now recompensed
for all my pains: hope re-entered my heart, and every moment I looked on
my beauteous introducer with complacency.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the 27th of November, a day, which I can never forget, the sun rose in
all its brilliance; I thanked Heaven, and hastened to place my rose-tree,
and such of its companions as yet survived, on a peristyle in the court.
(I have already mentioned that I lodged on the ground floor.) I watered
them, and went, as usual, to give my philosophical lecture. I then dined&mdash;drank
to the health of my rose&mdash;and returned to take my station in my
window, with a quicker throbbing of the heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Amelia&rsquo;s mother had been slightly indisposed; for eight days she had not
left the house, and consequently I had not seen my fair one. On the first
morning I had observed the physician going in; uneasy for her, I contrived
to cross his way, questioned him, and was comforted. I afterwards learned
that the old lady had recovered, and was to make her appearance abroad on
this day at a grand gala given by a baroness, who lived at the end of the
street. I was then certain to see Amelia pass by, and eight days of
privation had enhanced that thought; I am sure Madame de Belmont did not
look to this party with as much impatience as I did. She was always one of
the first: it had scarcely struck five, when I heard the bell of her gate.
I took up a book&mdash;there I was at my post&mdash;and presently I saw
Amelia appear, dazzling with dress and beauty as she gave her arm to her
mother: never yet had the brilliancy of her figure so struck me; this time
there was no occasion for her to speak to catch my eyes; they were fixed
on her, but her&rsquo;s were bent down; however, she guessed that I was there,
for she passed slowly to prolong my happiness. I followed her with my
gaze, until she entered the house; there only she turned her head for a
second; the door was shut, and she disappeared; but remained present to my
heart. I could neither close my window, nor cease to look at the
baroness&rsquo;s hotel, as if I could see Amelia through the walls; I remained
there till all objects were fading into obscurity&mdash;the approach of
night, and the frostiness of the air, brought to my recollection that the
rose-tree was still on the peristyle: never had it been so precious to me;
I hastened to it; and scarcely was I in the anti-chamber, when I heard a
singular noise, like that of an animal browsing, and tinkling its bells. I
trembled, I flew, and I had the grief to find a sheep quietly fixed beside
my rose-trees, of which it was making its evening repast with no small
avidity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I caught up the first thing in my way; it was a heavy cane: I wished to
drive away the gluttonous beast; alas! it was too late; he had just bitten
off the beautiful branch of buds; he swallowed them one after another; and
in spite of the gloom, I could see, half out of his mouth, the finest of
them all, which in a moment was champed like the rest. I was neither
ill-tempered, nor violent; but at this sight I was no longer master of
myself. Without well knowing what I did, I discharged a blow of my cane on
the animal, and stretched it at my feet.

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner did I perceive it motionless than I repented of having killed a
creature unconscious of the mischief it had done. Was this worthy of the
professor of philosophy, the adorer of the gentle Amelia? But thus to eat
up my rose-tree, my only hope to get admittance to her! When I thought on
its annihilation, I could not consider myself so culpable. However, the
night darkened; I heard the old servant crossing the lower passage, and I
called her. &lsquo;Catherine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;bring your light, there is mischief
here; you left the stable doon open (that of the court was also unclosed),
one of your sheep has been browsing on my rose-trees, and I have punished
it.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She soon came with a lanthorn in her hand. It is not one of our sheep,&rsquo; 
said she; &lsquo;I have just come from them; the stable gate is shut, and they
are all within. O, blessed saints! blessed saints! What do I see&rsquo;&mdash;exclaimed
she, when near, &lsquo;it is the pet sheep of our neighbour Mademoiselle de
Belmont. Poor Robin! what bad luck brought you here! O! how sorry she will
be.&rsquo; I nearly dropped down beside Robin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Of Mademoiselle Amelia!&rsquo; said I in a trembling voice; &lsquo;has she actually
a sheep?&rsquo; &lsquo;O! good Lord! no; she has none at this moment&mdash;but that
which lies there, with its four legs up in the air: she loved it as
herself; see the collar that she worked for it with her own hands.&rsquo; I bent
to look at it. It was of red leather, ornamented with little bells, and
she had embroidered on it, in gold thread&mdash;&lsquo;Robin belongs to Amelia
de Belmont; she loves him, and begs that he may be restored to her.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
will she think of the barbarian who killed him in a fit of passion&mdash;the
vice that she most detests; she is right, it has been fatal to her; yet if
he should be only stunned by a blow; Catherine, run, ask for some aether,
or <i>Eau de Vie</i>, or hartshorn,&mdash;run, Catherine, run!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Catherine set off; I tried to make it open its mouth,&mdash;my rose-bud
was still between its hermetically-sealed teeth; perhaps the collar
pressed it: in fact the throat was swelled. I got it off with difficulty;
something fell from it at my feet, which I mechanically took up and put
into my pocket without looking at, so much was I absorbed in anxiety for
the resuscitation. I rubbed him with all my strength; I grew more and more
impatient for the return of Catherine. She came with a small new phial in
her hand, calling out in her usual manner, &lsquo;Here, sir, here&rsquo;s the
medicine. I never opened my mouth about it to Mademoiselle Amelia; I pity
her enough without that.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;What is all this Catherine? where have you seen Mademoiselle Amelia? and
what is her affliction, if she does not know of her favourite&rsquo;s death?&rsquo; 
‘O, sir, this is a terrible day for the poor young lady. She was at the
end of the street searching for a ring which she had lost; and it was no
trifle, but the ring that her dead father had got as a present from the
Emperor, and worth, they say, more ducats than I have hairs on my head.
Her mother lent it to her to day for the party; she has lost it, she knows
neither how nor where, and never missed it till she drew off her glove at
supper. And, poor soul! the glove was on again in a minute, for fear it
should be seen that the ring was wanting, and she slipped out to search
for it along the street, but has found nothing.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It struck me that the substance that had fallen from the sheep&rsquo;s collar
had the form of a ring&mdash;could it possibly be!&mdash;I looked at it;
and judge of my joy!&mdash;it was Madame de Belmont&rsquo;s ring, and really
very beautiful and costly. A secret presentiment whispered to me that this
was a better means of presentation than the rose-tree. I pressed the
precious ring to my heart, and to my lips; assured myself that the sheep
was really dead; and leaving him stretched near the devastated rose-trees,
I ran into the street, dismissed those who were seeking in vain, and
stationed myself at my door to await the return of my neighbours. I saw
from a distance the flambeau that preceded them, quickly distinguished
their voices, and comprehended by them, that Amelia had confessed her
misfortune. The mother scolded bitterly; the daughter wept, and said,
‘Perhaps it may be found.&rsquo; &lsquo;O yes, perhaps,&rsquo;&mdash;replied the mother with
irritation, &lsquo;it is too rich a prize to him that finds it; the emperor gave
it to your deceased father, on the field, when he saved his life; he set
more value on it than on all he possessed besides, and now you have thus
flung it away; but the fault is mine for having trusted you with it. For
some time back you have seemed quite bewildered.&rsquo; I heard all this as I
followed at some paces behind them; they reached home; and I had the
cruelty to prolong, for some moments more, Amelia&rsquo;s mortification.&mdash;I
intended that the treasure should procure me the entrée of their dwelling,
and I waited till they had got up stairs. I then had myself announced as
the bearer of good news; I was introduced, and respectfully presented the
ring to Madame de Belmont: and how delighted seemed Amelia! and how
beautifully she brightened in her joy, not alone that the ring was found,
but that I was the finder. She cast herself on her mother&rsquo;s bosom, and
turning on me her eyes, humid with tears, though beaming with pleasure,
she clasped her hands, exclaiming, &lsquo;O, sir, what obligation, what
gratitude do we owe to you!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, Mademoiselle!&rsquo; returned I, &lsquo;you know not to whom you address the
term gratitude.&rsquo; &lsquo;To one who has conferred on me a great pleasure,&rsquo; said
she.&rsquo; &lsquo;To one who has caused you a serious pain&mdash;to the killer of
Robin.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You, sir?&mdash;I cannot credit it&mdash;why should you do so? you are
not so cruel.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;No, but I am so unfortunate. It was in opening his collar, which I have
also brought to you, that your ring fell on the ground&mdash;you promised
a great recompence to him who should find it. I dare to solicit that
recompence; grant me my pardon for Robin&rsquo;s death.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And I, sir, I thank you for it,&rsquo; exclaimed the mother. &lsquo;I never could
endure that animal; it took up Amelia&rsquo;s entire time, and wearied me out of
all patience with its bleating. If you had not killed it, Heaven knows
where it might have carried my diamond. But how did it get entangled in
the collar? Amelia, pray explain all this.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Amelia&rsquo;s heart was agitated; she was as much grieved that it was I who
had killed Robin, as that he was dead.&mdash;&lsquo;Poor Robin,&rsquo; said she,
drying a tear, &lsquo;he was rather too fond of running out; before leaving
home, I had put on his collar that he might not be lost&mdash;he had
always been brought back to me. The ring must have slipped under his
collar. I hastily drew on my glove, and never missed it till I was at
supper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;What good luck it was that he went straight to this gentleman&rsquo;s,&rsquo; 
observed the mother.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;for you,&rsquo; said Amelia; &lsquo;he was cruelly received&mdash;was it
such a crime, sir, to enter your door?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It was night,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I could not distinguish the collar, and I
learned, when too late, that the animal belonged to you.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Thank Heaven,
then, you did not know it!&rsquo; cried the mother, or where would have been my
ring?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is necessary at least,&rsquo; said Amelia, with emotion, &lsquo;that I should
know how my favourite could have so cruelly chagrined you.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;O Mademoiselle, he had devoured my hope, my happiness, a superb
rose-tree about to blow, that I had been long watching, and intended to
present to&mdash;to&mdash;a person on New-Year&rsquo;s-Day.&rsquo; Amelia smiled,
blushed, extended her lovely hand towards me, and murmured,&mdash;&lsquo;All is
pardoned.&rsquo; &lsquo;If it had eaten up a rose-tree about to blow,&rsquo; cried Madame de
Belmont, &lsquo;it deserved a thousand deaths. I would give twenty sheep for a
rose-tree in blow.&rsquo; &lsquo;And I am much mistaken,&rsquo; said Amelia, with the
sweetest <i>naïveté</i>, &lsquo;if this very rose-tree was not intended for
you.&rsquo; &lsquo;For me! you have lost your senses child; I have not the honour of
knowing the gentleman.&rsquo; &lsquo;But he knows your fondness for roses; I mentioned
it one day before him, the only time I ever met him, at Madame de S.&lsquo;s. Is
it not true, sir, that my unfortunate favourite had eaten up my mother&rsquo;s
rose-tree?&rsquo; I acknowledged it, and I related the course of education of my
fifty rose-trees.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame de Belmont laughed heartily, and said, &lsquo;she owed me a double
obligation.&rsquo; Mademoiselle Amelia has given me my recompence for the
diamond,&rsquo; said I to her;&mdash;&lsquo;I claim yours also, madame.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ask, sir&mdash;&rsquo; 
‘Permission to pay my respects sometimes to you!&rsquo; &lsquo;Granted,&rsquo; replied she,
gaily. I kissed her hand respectfully, that of her daughter tenderly, and
withdrew. But I returned the next day&mdash;and every day&mdash;I was
received with a kindness that each visit increased,&mdash;I was looked on
as one of the family. It was I who now gave my arm to Madame de Belmont to
conduct her to the evening parties; she presented me as her friend, and
they were no longer dull to her daughter. New-Year&rsquo;s-Day arrived. I had
gone the evening before to a sheepfold in the vicinity to purchase a lamb
similar to that I had killed. I collected from the different hot-houses
all the flowering rose-trees I could find; the finest of them was for
Madame de Belmont; and the roses of the others were wreathed in a garland
round the fleecy neck of the lamb. In the evening I went to my neighbours,
with my presents. &lsquo;Robin and the rose-tree are restored to life,&rsquo; said I,
in offering my homage, which was received with sensibility and
gratefulness. &lsquo;I also should like to give you a New-Year&rsquo;s-gift,&rsquo; said
Madame de Belmont to me, &lsquo;if I but knew what you would best like.&rsquo; &lsquo;What I
best like&mdash;ah! if I only dared to tell you.&rsquo; &lsquo;If it should chance now
to be my daughter&mdash;.&rsquo; I fell at her feet, and so did Amelia. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; 
said the kind parent, &lsquo;there then is your New-Year&rsquo;s-gift ready found;
Amelia gives you her heart, and I give you her hand.&rsquo; She took the rose
wreath from off the lamb, and twined it round our united hands. &lsquo;And my
Amelia,&rsquo; continued the old professor, as he finished his anecdote, passing
an arm round his companion as she sat beside him, &lsquo;My Amelia is still to
my eyes as beautiful, and to my heart as dear, as on the day when our
hands were bound together with a chain of flowers.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<h2>
THE MARCH OF MIND.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Job Spimkins, grocer and vestryman of Crutched-Friars, was a stout,
easy, good-natured, middle-aged gentleman, who&mdash;to adopt a mercantile
phrase&mdash;was &ldquo;well to do in the world,&rdquo; and had long borne an
exemplary character throughout his ward for sobriety, punctuality,
civility, and all those homely but well-wearing qualities which we are apt
to associate with trade. Punctuality, however, was the one leading feature
of his mind, which he carried to so extravagant a height, that having
formed a scale of moral duties, he had placed it in the very front rank,
side by side with honesty&mdash;or the art of driving a good bargain&mdash;and
just two above temperance, soberness and chastity. Even in his social
hours, this peculiar trait of character decided his predilections; for,
notwithstanding he was much given to keeping up feasts and holidays, and
had a high respect for Michaelmas-Day, Christmas-Day, Twelfth-Day,
New-Year&rsquo;s-Day, &amp;c., yet he always expressed an indifferent opinion of
Easter, because, like an Irishman&rsquo;s pay-day, it was seldom or never
punctual. Next to this engrossing hobby was our citizen&rsquo;s abhorrence of
poetry, an abhorrence which he extended with considerate impartiality to
every branch of literature.
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s works formed an exception. He pronounced his commercial
maxims to be the <i>chefs-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> of genius, and used to set them as
large text-copies for his son, when he and the school-bill came home
together for the holidays from Dr. Thickskull&rsquo;s academy at Camberwell. But
poetry&mdash;our prosaic citizen could not for the life of him abide it.
The only good thing, he used to say, he ever, yet saw in <i>verse</i>, was
the Rule of Three; and the only <i>rhymes</i> that had the slightest
reason to recommend them, were &ldquo;Thirty days hath September.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To these opinions Mrs. Spimkins, like a dutiful wife, never failed to
respond, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; In person, this good lady was short and stoutly timbered,
with a face on which lay the full sunshine of prosperity, in one broad,
unvaried grin. Three children were her&rsquo;s: three &ldquo;dear, delightful
children,&rdquo; as their grandmother by the father&rsquo;s side never failed to
declare, when punctually, every New-Year&rsquo;s-Day, she presented them each
with a five-shilling-piece, wrapt up in gilt-edged note-paper. Thomas, the
eldest, was a slim, sickly youth; easy, conceited, and eighteen: Martha,
the second, was a maiden of more sensibility than beauty: while Sophy, the
youngest and sprightliest, to a considerable portion of the maternal
simper and the paternal circumference, added a fine expanse of foot, which
spreading out semi-circularly, like a lady&rsquo;s fan, at the toes, gave a
peculiar weight and safety to her tread.
</p>
<p>
The habits of this amiable family were to the full as unassuming as their
manners. They dined at one o&rsquo;clock, with the exception of Sundays, when
the discussion of roast, or boiled, was, for fashion&rsquo;s sake, adjourned to
five; took tea at six; supped at nine; and retired to rest at ten. The
Sabbath, however, was a day not less of fashion than of luxury. The young
folks&mdash;Thomas, especially, who was growing, and wanted nourishment&mdash;were
then indulged with two glasses of port wine after dinner; and, at
tea-time, were made happy in the privilege of a &ldquo;blow out&rdquo; with one or
more friendly neighbours. Once every year they went half-price to the
Christmas pantomimes, a memorable epoch, which never failed to deprive
them of sleep, and disorganize their nervous system for at least a
fortnight beforehand. Such were the habits of the Spimkins&rsquo; family, a
family rich, respectable, and orderly, until the March of Mind, which our
modern philosophers are striving so hard to expedite, reduced them from
wealth to poverty; and, from having been the pride, compelled them to
become the pity of Crutched-Friars.
</p>
<p>
Every one must remember the strange, bewildering enthusiasm excited by Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s first appearance as a novelist. All the world was
Scott-struck. His songs were set to music; fair hands painted fire-screens
from his incidents; playwrights dramatized his heroes; and even the great
Mr. Alderman Dobbs himself was so enraptured with his descriptions of
Highland scenery, that he actually took an inside place in the Inverness
mail, in order, as he shrewdly remarked, &ldquo;to judge for himself with his
own eyes&rdquo;&mdash;a feat which he would infallibly have accomplished, but
for two reasons; first, that the coach passed the most picturesque part of
the Highlands in the night-time; secondly that the worthy alderman himself
fell fast asleep during the best part of his journey. He returned home,
however, as might have been expected, in ecstacies.
</p>
<p>
Among the number of those who caught this poetic influenza in its most
alarming form, were the two Misses Spinks, daughters of Mr. Common-Council
Spinks, once a mighty man on&rsquo; Change, but who had lately retired from
business to enjoy life, alternately at his town house in Crutched-Friars,
and his charming summer villa at Newington Butts, near the Montpellier Tea
Gardens. As these young ladies lived next door to Mr. Spimkins, and
cultivated the gentilities of society&mdash;a little neutralized, perhaps,
by the circumstance of their indulging in certain pleonastic peculiarities
of aspiration, by virtue of which the substantive &ldquo;air&rdquo; would be
accommodated with an <i>h</i>, and the adverb &ldquo;very&rdquo; be transformed into a
<i>wherry</i>&mdash;it may reasonably be inferred that they were much
looked up to by their neighbours. The Misses Spimkins, in particular, took
pattern by them in all things. They were the standards by which, in
secret, they regulated their demeanor&mdash;the mirror in which they
longed to see themselves at full-length reflected.
</p>
<p>
Things were in this state, when one morning Miss Spinks, a young lady of a
grave and intellectual cast of mind, with a face broad at the forehead and
peaked at the chin, like a kite, called at the Spimkinses for the purpose
of inquiring the character of a servant maid. The Spimkinses were
delighted by such condescension. Miss Spinks was such a charming young
woman! such a dear creature!&mdash;so well-bred, so well-dressed, and,
above all, so well-informed! Such, for at least a month afterwards, was
the hourly topic of conversation at the grocer&rsquo;s table: it came up with
the breakfast tray, it helped to digest the dinner, it served as a
night-cap after supper, until at length old Spimkins, in consideration of
his neighbour&rsquo;s importance, was prevailed on to depart so far from his
homely notions of household economy, as to allow his wife and children to
return Miss Spinks&rsquo; visit. In due time, both parties, as a matter of
course, became intimate; but as literature was all the rage at the common
councilman&rsquo;s, the Misses Spimkins were for a time at fault, until a
seasonable supply of novels, procured secretly from a fashionable
publisher in the Minories, enabled them to converse on a more equal
footing.
</p>
<p>
It was just about this period, that the Third Series of the Tales of My
Landlord appeared. The Spinkses, who had heard from Alderman Dobbs that
the descriptions were &ldquo;uncommon like natur,&rdquo; of course read it; so of
necessity did the Spimkinses; and, as Miss Spinks kept an album, it came
to pass that she one day commissioned Thomas Spimkins to copy into it a
few of the most notable passages. On what slight circumstances do the
leading events of life depend! The youth, delighted with his task,
ventured, after concluding it, to interpolate some stanzas of his own;
Miss Spinks inquired who was the author; when Tom, blushing, like <i>Mrs.
Malaprop</i>, &ldquo;confessed the soft impeachment,&rdquo; was instantly pronounced a
genius, and as such introduced by the Spinkses to all their high
acquaintances.
</p>
<p>
Genius! What a fatal talisman exists in that portentous word! How many
industrious families has it led astray! How much common-sense has it
shipwrecked! How many prospects, once bright and imposing, has it utterly,
incurably blighted!
</p>
<p>
Astonished at her son&rsquo;s promise, dazzled by the hopes of his preferment,
all Mrs. Spimkins&rsquo;s usual good sense forsook her. The wisdom of the world
was lost in the feelings of the mother. She gave play at once to the most
ambitious expectations, and resolved henceforth not to let an hour escape
without striving to inoculate her husband. With this view, she called
every possible resource to her aid. She appealed to his affection as a
father, to his pride as a man; she pointed out the injustice, not to say
the inhumanity, of thwarting the genius of Thomas; she talked of his
wealth, his deserts, his dignities; and, finally, by some miracle, for
which I have never yet been able to account, persuaded the old gentleman
to relax so liberally in his anti-poetic notions, as to despatch Thomas to
Oxford, where he would infallibly have gained the prize poem, had it not,
by some unaccountable mistake, been transferred to another.
</p>
<p>
It is from this period that the historian of the Spimkinses must date
their decline and fall. Thomas returned home in due time from the
university, a finished genius, but as poor as such geniuses are apt to be;
while his father, who now began to repent having sent him there, proposed
buying him a share in a grocer&rsquo;s shop at Whitechapel. But the gifted youth
disdained such base employment. He had a soul above figs! What! Thomas
Spimkins, Esq., of Brazen Nose, author of a poem which was within an inch
of gaining the Chancellor&rsquo;s prize, stand behind the counter in a white
apron, answering the demands of some uneducated customer for &ldquo;a quarter of
a pound of moist sugar, and change for sixpence!&rdquo; Impossible! the idea was
revolting to humanity!
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, something must be done: one cannot live upon gentility, even
though certificated at Oxford. Old Spimkins was precisely of this way of
thinking; so, as a next resource, proposed articling his son to an
attorney. But here again a difficulty presented itself. The business of a
solicitor requires, it is well known, the impudence of a Yorkshire
postboy, whereas Thomas was diffidence itself. Law, then, was out of the
question; the church presented equal impediments; the navy, though
respectable, was inappropriate; the army ruinously expensive. In this
exigence, nothing remained but literature; to which, after many an urgent,
impassioned, but fruitless remonstrance from his father, the young man
finally resolved to addict himself. Meanwhile, his kind patrons, the
Spinkses, thinking, naturally enough, that genius should vegetate among
congenial scenery, took him on a visit to their villa at Newington Butts,
where, in a romantic summer-house, built up of red bricks and
oyster-shells, he gave vent to some of the sweetest stanzas imaginable.
One of these, inspired by that poetic ceremony, the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show,
fell accidentally into the hands of his lordship himself, who pronounced
the author to be &ldquo;a clever fellow, and one as knew what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo; This
opinion, delivered in public by so great a judge, soon made the round of
Crutched-Friars; so that, whenever Thomas chanced to make his appearance
in public, the very shop-boys would whisper admiringly after him, &ldquo;I say,
Jack, there goes a poet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Behold, then, our sensitive minstrel, the pride of his neighbourhood, the
&ldquo;young Astyanax&rdquo; of his family! As such, it became him to affect
eccentricity. Accordingly, he grew &ldquo;melancholy and gentleman-like,&rdquo;
 eschewed his cravat, and even advised his father to addict himself to
Scott and Byron. But the old gentleman winced exceedingly at this
proposal. Recollections of a poetic apprentice he once had, who had for
some months carried on a very irregular flirtation with the till, came
thronging fast upon his mind, and spurred him at once to a refusal. But
what can resist the eternal solicitations of the shrewder sex? By day his
daughter, by night his wife, kept teazing him into gradual compliance with
their wishes. First he was prevailed on to dine at five, instead of two
o&rsquo;clock; secondly, to listen to his daughter&rsquo;s execution of &ldquo;Oh! &lsquo;tis
love, &lsquo;tis love!&rdquo; sung with a twist of the mouth peculiarly provocative of
that passion; and lastly (the severest cut of all), to give <i>conversaziones</i>
to his son&rsquo;s literary acquaintances.
</p>
<p>
At these parties, a strange and talented group never failed to present
themselves. All were men of genius, but exhibited, in their respective
persons, proofs of the amazing rancour that subsists between genius and
gentility. Among them was a lively Irishman, named O&rsquo;Blarney, a reporter
for the daily press, with sandy hair, a nose that turned up like a
fish-hook, and a mouth which, from its extensive dimensions, afforded the
most copious facilities for grinning. This promising young Papist, whose
estates unfortunately lay in the most Protestant part of Ireland, was the
very gem of Mr. Spimkins&rsquo; parties; and as he mixed much in fashionable
society, and could beat even a negro in dancing, his presence never failed
to create a lively sensation at Crutched-Friars. Another of the old
gentleman&rsquo;s guests was a rising versifier of twenty-two, whose appearance
would have been sentiment itself, had not a pair of dingy whiskers, which
grew back towards his ears, as if enamoured of the latter&rsquo;s unusual
length, given him a slight touch of the grotesque. As it was, his fine,
open, full-blown face, resembled a cherub on a country tomb-stone. It
would be injustice to acknowledged ability were I here to omit the mention
of another poet, whose genius taking an uxorious turn, exploded in
admiring apostrophes to his wife. This bard displayed infinite sweetness
of versification&mdash;as the extracts from the different reviews,
inserted, accidentally, at the end of his volume&mdash;assured him. There
were no intemperate sallies, no startling originality, no audacious
imagery in his rhymes; all was sweetly and agreeably uniform, like the
features on a barber&rsquo;s block. Such, with the addition of three historians
from St. Mary Axe, two political economists from Long Acre, a pastoral
writer from Wapping, and an essayist from Houndsditch, were the <i>literati</i>
whose dazzling abilities illumined the fortunate neighbourhood of
Crutched-Friars. Old Spimkins, meanwhile, to whom the whole scene was a
novelty that well nigh took away his breath, kept moving backwards and
forwards among his guests, oscillating in spirits, between a sigh and a
smile; at one moment looking grave and dignified, like the Scotch
Highlander at a tobacconist&rsquo;s; at another, simpering sweetly and benignly,
and perpetrating, whenever he ventured on a remark, the strangest possible
blunders. The three French consuls he invariably mistook for the three per
cent, consols; quoted Moore&rsquo;s Almanack in illustration of Moore&rsquo;s
Melodies; inquired whether those two great poets, Hogg and Bacon, were not
of the same family; and, when asked his opinion of Crabbe, gave a decided
preference to lobster.
</p>
<p>
This sort of work had continued for the best part of a year, during which
time the good-natured old grocer had been subjected to every species of
expence and annoyance; when one morning, towards the close of October,
news arrived that a literary gentleman, for whom his son had persuaded him
to become bail to a pretty considerable amount, had presented him in
return, with what is termed leg-bail&mdash;a species of gratitude whereby
the locomotive powers are exercised at the expense of principle. The same
post brought a letter from Miss Spinks at Newington, with the intelligence
that Sophy&mdash;the sprightly Sophy Spimkins&mdash;who had been on a
visit there for some days, had just set out with O&rsquo;Blarney, on a hasty
visit of inspection to the latter&rsquo;s estates at Monaghan. This letter
enclosed another from the fair fugitive herself, in which she implored her
father&rsquo;s forgiveness for the &ldquo;rash step&rdquo; she had taken; but assured him
that immediately on her arrival at the old family castle, she should
become Mrs. O&rsquo;Blarney, and return home the very instant that her husband
had secured his election for the county. The epistle concluded with
affectionate remembrances to the family circle, and a hope that, when
things were a little in order, her eldest sister would be prevailed upon
to accompany her back to Monaghan.
</p>
<p>
This intelligence, notwithstanding his son&rsquo;s very sanguine anticipations
on the subject, annoyed poor Mr. Spimkins exceedingly; while, as if to
fill up the measure of his tribulation, his former acquaintance at
Crutched-Friars, finding that, for months past, he had shewn evident
symptoms of a wish to cut them, began in self-defence, to set up reports
injurious to his reputation. Rumours so circulated soon obtained belief.
First one customer dropped off&mdash;then a second&mdash;then a third&mdash;then
a fourth, fifth, and sixth&mdash;until at length the whole neighbourhood
set it down, confidently down in their minds, that the Spimkinses were a
losing family. Even the parish-clerk himself, a person of considerable
local authority, was heard to observe that they were getting too clever
for business&mdash;an opinion which, pronounced gravely and oracularly by
a gentleman in a double chin, produced an instantaneous effect.
</p>
<p>
But where all this time were the Spinkses? Where were they whose patronage
should have shielded, and whose kindness should have cherished, the
unfortunate but still interesting Spimkinses? Alas! they had set out, only
a few weeks before, for the Holy Land, with the avowed intention of taking
furnished lodgings for at least six months at Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
As if this, of itself, were not sufficiently vexatious, Miss Spimkins took
it into her head to espouse a gentleman for the very last thing a lady
usually thinks of looking for in a husband&mdash;his intellect. The origin
of her amour is curious. She had read in the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, the
&ldquo;Confessions of a Wanderer,&rdquo; who had been shipwrecked on the Thames, at
night-fall, off Chelsea Reach; which Confessions were penned in so poetic
a spirit, and described so feelingly the horrors of the catastrophe, the
hoarse dash of the waves&mdash;the howling of the winds&mdash;and the
subsequent encounter of the vessel against the fourth arch of Battersea
bridge, that the susceptible Miss Spimkins was on thorns till she became
acquainted with the author. This, by her brother&rsquo;s intervention, was soon
brought about; an invitation to dinner confirmed the intimacy; the lady,
like <i>Desdemona</i>, loved the Wanderer &ldquo;for the perils he had passed;&rdquo;
 and he, like <i>Othello</i>, &ldquo;loved her that she did pity them.&rdquo; It has
been well said, one marriage makes many: scarcely had his sister embraced
the nuptial state, when Thomas handed to the same altar a widow lady, whom
he had accidentally met at Margate, and had mistaken for a person of
quality, but who had since turned out to be the leading tragic actress of
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, at a rising salary of eighteen shillings per week,
exclusive of benefits. It is but justice to add, that if this young lady
brought her husband no fortune, she brought him, what to a sensitive mind
is infinitely preferable, two fine boys, one of whom was breeched, the
other yet in petticoats.
</p>
<p>
Such accumulated incidents&mdash;calamities he ungratefully called them&mdash;occurring
to old Spimkins at a period when the mind, having lost the first
elasticity of youth, is not yet mellowed down into the philosophy of age,
but stands, restless and unsettled, between the two, in a sort of
crepuscular condition, heaped &ldquo;sackcloth and ashes on his head.&rdquo; He
neglected his ledger, he neglected his house, he neglected himself, and,
worst of all, he neglected his customers. In fact, for months together, he
did nothing but sigh and swear. His family, even in this exigency, could
render him not the slightest assistance. His daughter, who still lived
with him, had, by a diligent cultivation of the intellect, long since
forgotten the household duties of a wife; her husband, as the old man used
often to remark, &ldquo;was of no more use than a cargo of damaged coffee;&rdquo; and
even Thomas&mdash;the inspired Thomas himself&mdash;had dwindled down into
a mere mortal, and now dwelt in aerial seclusion up two pair of stairs at
Pentonville. Thus widowed in his age&mdash;for his wife, I should observe,
had, three months since, transferred herself from his to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom&mdash;the
disconsolate grocer abruptly sold his business, pensioned off his daughter
and her &ldquo;Wanderer,&rdquo; and retired alone, on a small annuity, to a back
street in Islington&mdash;a memorable illustration of&rsquo; the March of Mind
and its very peculiar concomitants.
</p>
<p>
Here it was that I first became acquainted with him, and gleaned the
particulars of the history I have just ventured to sketch. Our intimacy
continued upwards of a year, during which period I will do my old friend
the justice to say, that I heard the anecdote of the poetic apprentice who
had robbed him, at least a dozen times. Now and then, when I ventured to
express my astonishment that a tradesman of his good sense, who held such
proper notions on the score of poetry and punctuality, should have so far
forgotten himself as to have encouraged the one, and abandoned the other,
to his own manifest ruin, the venerable sage would answer, &ldquo;True Sir, but
it was all my wife&rsquo;s doing. She kept perpetually telling me that the
Spinkses&mdash;who, one would have thought must have been good judges, for
they were capital customers, and always paid their way&mdash;had
pronounced my son to be a genius, and that it was a shame to thwart his
abilities; so I was over-persuaded, you see, to send him to college, when,
had he but stuck to business, who knows but he might have become a
common-councilman; or, perhaps, even in time a sheriff! But there&rsquo;s no
doing any thing with poets. I remember an apprentice of mine, once&mdash;&mdash;
But I see you&rsquo;re affected!&rdquo;&mdash;and here the old man would pause, shake
the ashes from his pipe, and then revert to some less ungracious topic. It
was on one of these occasions, when, having concluded a longer story than
usual, he had stopped to take his customary allowance of breath, that on
waking from a nap which his affecting anecdotes rarely failed to bring on,
I found him stretched in an apoplectic fit upon the floor. With some
difficulty he was brought to his senses; but, a relapse occurring in a few
days, it became but too evident that, like the late John Wesley, he had
had a call&mdash;that, in short, his closing hour was come. I was with him
in his last extremity, and have every reason to be satisfied with the
Christian character of his exit. He swore most incredibly at all poets;
left Thomas his blessing and six half-crowns; his daughter a MS. Essay, by
the political economist of Houndsditch; and then, with a convulsive jerk
of his left leg, which lamed the bed-post for life, set out on his travels
to eternity, with the story of the apprentice on his lips.
</p>
<p>
Of his three children, Thomas is the sole survivor. The &ldquo;Wanderer&rsquo;s&rdquo; wife
was taken off, about a fortnight since, by dyspepsia, the consequence of
inordinate indulgence in tripe and toast-and-water; while her sprightly
sister, Sophy, threw herself headlong into a mill-pond at Holyhead (having
previously tied down her petticoats at the ankles), on being informed by
O&rsquo;Blarney, in one of those confidential moments which brandy-and-water
seldom fails to elicit, that he was already the devoted husband of three
wives and a proportionate abundance of pledges, and had quitted London,
not so much with a view to visit any Irish estates&mdash;which, as a
matter of course, existed only in his fancy&mdash;as to obviate the
personal inconveniences likely to arise from the circumstance of his
having, in a moment of forgetfulness, appropriated to his own use the
purse and pocket-book of one of his most intimate and valued
acquaintances. The poor girl&rsquo;s body was fished up, a few days afterwards,
by a Welsh clergyman, who was trolling in spectacles for pike: and a
coroner&rsquo;s inquest having been summoned, the evidence of O&rsquo;Blarney was
taken, from which it clearly appeared that the deceased was at times
insane, and, only two hours before her death, had made three attempts to
swallow a salt-cellar. The young Irishman deposed to these and other facts
with so much feeling, earnestness, and simplicity, that the coroner
complimented him highly on his humanity; and an account of the inquest
having been furnished by himself for the <i>North Wales Chronicle</i>, it
soon afterwards made the round of the London newspapers, under the title
of &ldquo;Distressing Suicide.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Of poor Thomas, my account, I grieve to say, must be equally
disheartening. An epic poem, on which he had been some months engaged,
having not only failed, but even contributed to introduce its publisher to
ready-furnished lodgings in the Fleet, he is now driven to the necessity
of jobbing for minor periodicals, thereby adding one more to the already
swollen catalogue of those who, mistaking the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of
vanity for the sober radiance of intellect, start off prematurely on the
voyage of life, without pilot to steer, compass to direct, or ballast to
steady their course.
</p>
<p>
When I called on the young man, a few mornings since, I was much struck
with his more than usually picturesque condition. Being always fond of
air, he had hired a back attic, overlooking two charming gardens filled
with clothes&rsquo;-lines, and commanding a distant view of some brick-fields, a
pig, and an Irish hodman from Carrickfergus. His wife was seated at the
fire, watching a leg of mutton as it pirouetted before the grate, at the
end of a bit of whipcord: Fernando, her eldest boy, was riding with
manifest ecstacy on the back of an old chair: and her two other darling
babes, Alphonso and Eleonora, were fast asleep, on a turn-up bedstead, in
an adjoining room. Close by Thomas, who was busy writing reviews at a deal
table with three legs, was an elderly cotton shirt, hanging to dry on a
small wooden horse, quite a pony in its dimensions; and at the further end
of the room, near the door, stood a pot of half-and-half, a pen&rsquo;orth of
pickled cabbage in a tea-cup, a twopenny French roll, a black horn dinner
knife, and a fork with two prongs, both of which were broken. On observing
these evident symptoms of domestic conviviality, I abruptly hastened my
departure; but, on my return home by way of Crutched-Friars, could not
refrain from stopping an instant in order to survey my old friend&rsquo;s
establishment. It was in the most deplorable condition possible. The voice
of its till was mute; the very fixtures themselves were removed; and
advertisements, three deep, specifying in large red characters the virtues
of Daffy&rsquo;s Elixir, were posted up, on door, wall, and window-shutter.
Altogether, the scene was of the most affecting character, and forcibly
impressed on my mind the calamities attendant on what Shakspeare calls
&ldquo;ill-judged ambition.&rdquo;

<h2>
THE OLD GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S TEETOTUM.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the foot of the long range of the Mendip hills, standeth a village,
which, for obvious reasons, we shall conceal the precise locality of, by
bestowing thereon, the appellation of Stockwell. The principal trade of
the Stockwellites is in coals, which certain of the industrious operative
natives sedulously employ themselves in extracting from our mother earth,
while others are engaged in conveying the &ldquo;black diamonds,&rdquo; to various
adjacent towns, in carts of sundry shapes and dimensions. The horses
engaged in this traffic are of the Rosinante species, and, too often,
literally raw-boned.
</p>
<p>
Stockwell, moreover, hath its inn, or public house, a place of no small
importance, having for its sign a swinging creaking board whereon is
emblazoned the effigy of a roaring, red, and rampant lion.&mdash;High
towering above the said lion are the branches of a solitary elm, the foot
of which is encircled by a seat, especially convenient for those guests
whose taste it is to &ldquo;blow a cloud&rdquo; in the open air; and it is of two
individuals, who were much given thereon to enjoy their &ldquo;<i>otium cum
dignitate</i>,&rdquo; that we are about to speak.
</p>
<p>
George Syms had long enjoyed a monopoly in the shoemaking and cobbling
line (though latterly two oppositionists had started against him), and
Peter Brown was a man well to do in the world, being &ldquo;the man wot&rdquo; shod
the raw-boned horses before-mentioned, &ldquo;him and his father, and
grandfather,&rdquo; as the parish-clerk said, &ldquo;for time immemorial.&rdquo; These two
worthies were regaling themselves, as was their wonted custom, each with
his pint, upon a small table, which was placed for their accommodation,
when an elderly stranger, of a shabby genteel appearance, approached the
Lion, and inquired the road to an adjoining village.&mdash;&ldquo;You are late,
Sir,&rdquo; said George Syms. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the stranger, &ldquo;I am;&rdquo; and he threw
himself on the bench, and took off his hat, and began to call about him,
notwithstanding his shabby appearance, with the air of one who has money
in his pocket to pay his way. &ldquo;Three make good company,&rdquo; observed Peter
Brown. &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Holloa, there! bring me another pint!
This walk has made me confoundedly thirsty. You may as well make it a pot&mdash;and
be quick!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Messrs. Brown and Syms were greatly pleased with this additional guest at
their symposium; and the trio sat and talked of the wind, and the weather,
and the roads, and the coal trade, and drank and smoked to their hearts&rsquo; 
content, till time began to hang heavy, and then the stranger asked the
two friends, if ever they played at tee-to-tum. &ldquo;Play at what?&rdquo; asked
Peter Brown. &ldquo;Play at what?&rdquo; inquired George Syms. &ldquo;At tee-to-tum,&rdquo;
 replied the stranger, gravely taking a pair of spectacles from one pocket
of his waistcoat, and the machine in question from the other. &ldquo;It is an
excellent game, I assure you. Rare sport, my masters!&rdquo; and he forthwith
began to spin his teetotum upon the table, to the no small diversion of
George Syms and Peter Brown, who opined that the potent ale of the ramping
Red Lion had done its office.&mdash;&ldquo;Only see how the little fellow runs
about!&rdquo; cried the stranger, in apparent ecstacy. &ldquo;Holloa, there! Bring a
lantern! There he goes, round and round&mdash;and now he&rsquo;s asleep&mdash;and
now he begins to reel&mdash;wiggle-waggle&mdash;-down he tumbles! What
colour, for a shilling?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the game,&rdquo; said Peter
Brown. &ldquo;Nor I, neither,&rdquo; quoth George Syms: &ldquo;but it seems easy enough to
learn&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;you think so, do you? But, let
me tell you that there&rsquo;s a great deal more in it than you imagine. There
he is, you see, with as many sides as a modern politician, and as many
colours as an Algerine.&mdash;Come, let us have a game! This is the way!&rdquo;
 and he again sat the teetotum in motion, and capered about in exceeding
glee. &ldquo;He, he, he!&rdquo; uttered George Syms; and &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter
Brown; and, being wonderfully tickled with the oddity of the thing, they
were easily persuaded by the stranger just to take a game together for
five minutes, while he stood by as umpire, with a stopwatch in his hand.
</p>
<p>
When precisely five minutes had elapsed, although it was Peter Brown&rsquo;s
spin, and the teetotum was yet going its rounds, and George Syms had
called out yellow, he demurely took it from the table and put it in his
pocket, and then, returning his watch to his fob, walked away into the Red
Lion, without as much as saying good-night. The two friends looked at each
other in surprise, and then indulged in a very loud and hearty fit of
laughter; and then paid their reckoning, and went away exceedingly merry,
which they would not have been, had they understood properly what they had
been doing.
</p>
<p>
In the meanwhile, the stranger had entered the house; and he found it not
very difficult to persuade them likewise to take a game at teetotum for
five minutes, which he terminated in the same unceremonious way as that
under the tree, and then desired to be shown the room wherein he was to
sleep. Mrs. Philpot immediately, contrary to her usual custom, jumped up
with great alacrity, lighted a candle, and conducted her guest to his
apartment; while Sally, contrary to <i>her</i> usual custom, reclined
herself in her mistress&rsquo;s great arm-chair, yawned three or four times, and
then exclaimed, &ldquo;Heigho! it&rsquo;s getting very late! I wish my husband would
come home!&rdquo; Now as we are not fond of useless mysteries, we think proper
to tell the reader, that the teetotum in question had the peculiar
property of causing those who played therewith to lose all remembrance of
their former character, and to adopt that of their antagonists in the
game. During the process of spinning, the personal identity of the two
players was completely changed. Now, on the evening of this memorable day,
Jacob Philpot, the landlord of the rampant Red Lion, had spent a few
convivial hours with mine host of the Blue Boar, a house on the road-side,
about two miles from Stockwell; and the two publicans had discussed the
ale, grog, and tobacco, in the manner customary with Britons, whose
insignia are roaring, rampant red lions, green dragons, blue boars, &amp;c.
Therefore, when Jacob came home, he began to call about him, with the air
of one who purposeth that his arrival shall be no secret; and very
agreeably surprised was he when Mrs. Philpot ran out from the house, and
assisted him to dismount, for Jacob was somewhat rotund; and yet more did
he marvel, when, instead of haranguing him in a loud voice (as she had
whilom done on similar occasions, greatly to his discomfiture), she
good-humouredly said that she would lead his nag to the stable, and then
go and call Philip the ostler. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the host of the Lion, leaning
with his back against the door-post, &ldquo;after a calm comes a storm. She&rsquo;ll
make up for this presently, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo; But Mrs. Philpot put up the
horse, and called Philip, and then returned in peace and quietness, and
attempted to pass into the house, without uttering a word to her lord and
master.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, my dear?&rdquo; asked Jacob Philpot; &ldquo;a&rsquo;nt you
well?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Philpot, &ldquo;very well, I thank you.&mdash;But
pray take away your leg, and let me go into the house.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t
you think I was very late?&rdquo; asked Jacob. &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Philpot; &ldquo;when gentlemen get together, they don&rsquo;t think how time goes.&rdquo;
 Poor Jacob was quite delighted, and, as it was dusk, and by no means, as
he conceived, a scandalous proceeding, he forthwith put one arm round Mrs.
Philpot&rsquo;s neck, and stole a kiss, whereat she said, &ldquo;Oh dear me! how could
you think of doing such a thing?&rdquo; and immediately squeezed herself past
him, and ran into the house, where Sally sat, in the armchair before
mentioned, with a handkerchief over her head, pretending to be asleep.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; said Jacob to his wife, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you in such good
humour. You shall make me a glass of rum and water, and take some of it
yourself.&rdquo; He then good-humouredly told her to go to bed, and he would
follow her presently, as soon as he had looked after his horse, and pulled
off his boots. This proposition was no sooner made, than the good man&rsquo;s
ears were suddenly grasped from behind, and his head was shaken and
twisted about, as though it had been the purport of the assailant to
wrench it from his shoulders. Mrs. Philpot instantly made her escape from
the kitchen, leaving her spouse in the hands of the enraged Sally, who,
under the influence of the teetotum delusion, was firmly persuaded that
she was justly inflicting wholesome discipline upon her husband, whom she
had, as she conceived, caught in the act of making love to the maid. Sally
was active and strong, and Jacob Philpot was, as before hinted, somewhat
obese, and, withal, not in excellent &ldquo;wind;&rdquo; consequently it was some time
ere he could disengage himself; and then he stood panting and blowing, and
utterly lost in astonishment, while Sally saluted him with divers
appellations, which it would not be seemly here to set down.
</p>
<p>
When Jacob did find his tongue, however, he answered her much in the same
style; and added, that he had a great mind to lay a stick about her back.
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; strike a woman! &ldquo;Eh&mdash;would you, you coward?&rdquo;&mdash;and
immediately she darted forward, and, as she termed it, put her mark upon
him with her nails, whereby his rubicund countenance was greatly
disfigured, and his patience entirely exhausted: but Sally was too nimble,
and made her escape up stairs. So the landlord of the Red Lion, having got
rid of the two mad or drunken women, very philosophically resolved to sit
down for half an hour by himself, to think oyer the business, while he
took his &ldquo;night cap.&rdquo; He had scarcely brewed the ingredients, when he was
roused by a rap at the window; and, in answer to his inquiry of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; he recognised the voice of his neighbour, George Syms, and, of
course, immediately admitted him; for George was a good customer, and,
consequently, welcome at all hours. &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Syms, &ldquo;I dare
say you are surprised to see me here at this time of night; but I can&rsquo;t
get into my own house. My wife is drunk, I believe.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And so is
mine,&rdquo; quoth the landlord; &ldquo;so sit you down and make yourself comfortable.
Hang me if I think I&rsquo;ll go to bed to night!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No more will I,&rdquo; said
Syms; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job to do early in the morning, and then I shall be
ready for it.&rdquo; So the two friends sat down, and had scarcely begun to
enjoy themselves, when another rap was heard at the window, and mine host
recognised the voice of Peter Brown, who came with the same complaint
against his wife, and was easily persuaded to join the party, each
declaring that the women must have contrived to meet, during their absence
from home, and all got fuddled together. Matters went on pleasantly enough
for some time, while they continued to rail against the women; but, when
that subject was exhausted, George Syms, the shoe-maker, began to talk
about shoeing horses; and Peter Brown, the Blacksmith, averred that he
could make a pair of jockey boots with any man for fifty miles round. The
host of the rampant Red Lion considered these things at first as a sort of
joke, which he had no doubt, from such good customers, was exceedingly
good, though he could not exactly comprehend it. But when Peter Brown
answered to the name of George Syms, and George Syms responded to that of
Peter Brown, he was somewhat more bewildered, and could not help thinking
that his guests had drunk quite enough. He, however, satisfied himself
with the reflection that that was no business of his, and that &ldquo;a man must
live by his trade.&rdquo; With the exception of these apparent occasional cross
purposes, conversation went on as well as could be expected under existing
circumstances, and the three unfortunate husbands sat and talked, and
drank, and smoked, till tired nature cried, &ldquo;hold, enough!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Leaving them to their slumbers, we must now say a word or two about the
teetotum, the properties of which were to change people&rsquo;s characters,
spinning the mind of one man or woman into the body of another. The
duration of the delusion, caused by this droll game of the old
gentleman&rsquo;s, depended upon the length of time spent in the diversion; and
five minutes was the specific period for causing it to last till the next
sun-rise or sun-set <i>after</i> the change had been effected. Therefore,
when the morning came, Mrs. Philpot and Sally, and Peter Brown and George
Syms, all came to their senses. The two latter went quietly home with
aching heads and very confused recollections of the preceding evening; and
shortly after their departure Mrs. Philpot awoke in great astonishment at
finding herself in the garret; and Sally was equally surprised and much
alarmed, at finding herself in her mistress&rsquo;s room, from which she
hastened in quick time, leaving all things in due order.
</p>
<p>
The elderly stranger made his appearance soon after, and appeared to have
brushed up his shabby genteel clothes, for he really looked much more
respectable than on the preceding evening. He ordered his breakfast, and
sat down thereto very quietly, and asked for the newspaper, and pulled out
his spectacles, and began to con the politics of the day much at his ease,
no one having the least suspicion that he and his teetotum had been the
cause of all the uproar at the Red Lion. In due time the landlord made his
appearance, with sundry marks of violence upon his jolly countenance, and,
after due obeisance made to his respectable-looking guest, took the
liberty of telling his spouse that he should insist upon her sending Sally
away, for he had never been so mauled since he was born; but Mrs. Philpot
told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself, and she was very glad the
girl had spirit enough to protect herself, and that she wouldn&rsquo;t part with
her on any account. She then referred to what had passed in the back
kitchen, taking to herself the credit of having inflicted that punishment
which had been administered by the hands of Sally.
</p>
<p>
Jacob Philpot was now more than ever convinced that his wife had been
paying her respects to a huge stone bottle of rum which stood in the
closet; and he &ldquo;made bold&rdquo; to tell her his thoughts, whereat Mrs. Philpot
thought fit to put herself into a tremendous passion, although she could
not help fearing that, perhaps, she might have taken a drop too much of
something, for she was unable, in any other manner, to account for having
slept in the garret.
</p>
<p>
The elderly stranger now took upon himself to recommend mutual
forgiveness, and stated that it was really quite pardonable for any one to
take a little too much of such very excellent ale as that at the Red Lion.
&ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I didn&rsquo;t get a trifle
beyond the mark myself last night. But I hope, madam, I did not annoy
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no, not at all, Sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Philpot, whose good-humour
was restored at this compliment, paid to the good cheer of the Lion, &ldquo;you
were exceeding pleasant, I assure you, just enough to make you funny; we
had a hearty laugh about the teetotum, you know.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the
stranger, &ldquo;I guess how it was then. I always introduce the teetotum when I
want to be merry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jacob Philpot expressed a wish to understand the game, and after spinning
it two or three times, proposed to take his chance, for five minutes, with
the stranger; but the latter, laughing heartily, would by no means agree
with the proposition, and declared that it would be downright cheating, as
he was an overmatch for any beginner. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as soon as
any of your neighbours come in, I&rsquo;ll put you in the way of it, and we&rsquo;ll
have some of your ale, now, just to pass the time. It will do neither of
us any harm after last night&rsquo;s affair, and I want to have some talk with
you about the coal trade.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They accordingly sat down together, and the stranger displayed
considerable knowledge in the science of mining; and Jacob was so much
delighted with his companion, that an hour or two slipped away, as he
said, &ldquo;in no&rdquo; and then there was heard the sound of a horse&rsquo;s feet at the
door, and a somewhat authoratative hillo!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is our parson,&rdquo; said Jacob, starting up, and he ran to the door to
enquire what might be his reverence&rsquo;s pleasure. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the
Reverend Mr. Stanhope. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to dine with our club at the Old
Boar, and I want you just to cast your eye on those fellows in my home
close; you can see them out of your parlour window.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, to be
sure, Sir,&rdquo; replied Jacob &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; quoth Mr. Stanhope, &ldquo;have you any body
indoors?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Sir, we have,&rdquo; replied Jacob, &ldquo;a strange gentleman,
who seems to know a pretty deal about mining and them sort of things. I
think he&rsquo;s some great person in disguise, he seems regularly edicated, up
to every thing.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Eh, ah! a great person in disguise!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Stanhope; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just step in a minute. It seems as if there was a shower
coming over, and I&rsquo;m in no hurry, and it is not worth while to get wet
through for the sake of a few minutes.&rdquo; So he alighted from his horse,
soliloquizing to himself. &ldquo;Perhaps the Lord Chancellor! Who knows?
However, I shall take care to show my principles;&rdquo; and straightway he went
into the house, and was most respectfully saluted by the elderly stranger;
and they entered into a conversation upon the standing English topics of
weather, wind, crops, and the coal trade; and Mr. Stanhope contrived to
introduce therein sundry unkind things against the Pope and all his
followers; and avowed himself a staunch &ldquo;church and king&rdquo; man, and spake
enthusiastically of our &ldquo;glorious constitution,&rdquo; and lauded divers
individuals then in power, but more particularly those who studied the
true interests of the church, by seeking out and preferring men of merit
and talent to fill vacant benefices. The stranger thereat smiled
significantly, as though he could, if he felt disposed, say something to
the purpose; and Mr. Stanhope felt more inclined than ever to think the
landlord might have conjectured very near the truth, and consequently,
redoubled his efforts to make the agreeable, professing his regret at
being obliged to dine out that day, &amp;c. The stranger politely thanked
him for his polite consideration, and stated that he was never at a loss
for employment, and that he was then rambling, for a few days, to relax
his mind from the fatigues of an overwhelming mass of important business,
to which his duty compelled him to attend early and late. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;you will smile when I tell you that I am now engaged in a
series of experiments relative to the power of the centrifugal force, and
its capacity of overcoming various degrees of friction.&rdquo; (Here he produced
the teetotum.) &ldquo;You perceive the different surfaces of the under edge of
this little thing. The outside, you see, is all of ivory, but indented in
various ways; and yet I have not been able to decide whether the roughest
or smoothest more frequently arrest its motions. The colours, of course,
are merely indications. Here is my register, and he produced a book,
wherein divers mathematical abstruse calculations were apparent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I always prefer other people to spin it, as then I obtain a variety of
impelling power. Perhaps you will do me the favour just to twirl it round
a few times alternately with the landlord? Two make a fairer experiment
than one. Just for five minutes. I&rsquo;ll not trouble you a moment longer, I
promise you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; thought Mr. Stanhope&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Learned men, now and then,
Have very strange vagaries!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
However, he commenced spinning the teetotum, turn and turn with Jacob
Philpot, who was highly delighted both with the drollery of the thing, and
the honour of playing with the parson of the parish, and laughed most
immoderately, while the stranger stood by, looking at his stop-watch as
demurely as on the preceding evening, until the five minutes had expired;
and then, in the middle of the Reverend Mr. Stanhope&rsquo;s spin, he took up
the little toy and put it into his pocket.
</p>
<p>
Jacob Philpot immediately arose, and shook the stranger warmly by the
hand, and told him, that he should be happy to see him whenever he came
that way again; and then nodding to Mr. Stanhope and the landlady, went
out at the front door, mounted the horse that stood there, and rode away.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fellow going?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Philpot; &ldquo;Hillo! Jacob, I say!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well
mother,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Stanhope, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;&mdash;but
Mrs. Philpot had reached the front of the house, and continued to shout.
&ldquo;Hillo! hillo, come back, I tell you!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That woman is always doing
some strange thing or other,&rdquo; observed Mr. Stanhope to the stranger &ldquo;What
on earth can possess her to go calling after the parson in that manner?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
declare he&rsquo;s rode off with squire Jones&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Philpot,
re-entering the house. &ldquo;To be sure he has,&rdquo; said Mr. Stanhope; &ldquo;he
borrowed it on purpose to go to the Old Boar.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; exclaimed
the landlady; &ldquo;and without telling me a word about it! But I&rsquo;ll Old Boar
him I promise you!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a fool of yourself, mother,&rdquo;
 said the parson; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t signify twopence to you where he goes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Philpot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, your worship-&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worship me woman,&rdquo; exclaimed the teetotum landlord parson; &ldquo;worship, what
nonsense now! Why, you&rsquo;ve been taking your drops again this morning, I
think. Worship, indeed! To be sure, I did once, like a fool, promise to
worship <i>you</i>; but if my time was to come over again, I know what-.
But, never mind now&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s twelve o&rsquo;clock? Come, quick,
let us have what there is to eat, and then we&rsquo;ll have a comfortable pipe
under the tree. What say you, Sir?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; replied the
elderly stranger. The latter hoped they should have the pleasure of Mrs.
Philpot&rsquo;s company; but she looked somewhat doubtfully till the parson
said, &ldquo;Come, come, mother, don&rsquo;t make a bother about it.&rdquo; Therefore she
smoothed her apron and made one at the dinner table, and conducted herself
with so much precision, that the teetotum parson looked upon her with
considerable surprise, while she regarded him with no less, inasmuch as he
talked in a very unclerical manner; and, among other strange things,
swore, that his wife was as &ldquo;drunk as blazes&rdquo; the night before, and winked
at her, and behaved altogether in a style very unbecoming a minister in
his own parish.
</p>
<p>
At one o&rsquo;clock there was a great sensation caused in the village of
Stockwell, by the appearance of their reverend pastor and the elderly
stranger, sitting on the bench which went round the tree, which stood
before the sign of the roaring rampant Red Lion, each with a long pipe in
his mouth, blowing clouds, which would not have disgraced the most
inveterate smoker of the &ldquo;black diamond&rdquo; fraternity, and ever and anon
moistening their clay with &ldquo;heavy wet,&rdquo; from tankards placed upon a small
table, which Mrs. Philpot had provided for their accommodation. The little
boys and girls first approached within a respectful distance, and then ran
away giggling to tell their companions; and they told their mothers, who
came and peeped likewise; and many were diverted, and many were
scandalized at the sight; yet the parson seemed to care for none of these
things, but cracked his joke, and sipped his ale, and smoked his pipe,
with as much easy nonchalance as if he had been in his own arm-chair at
the rectory. Yet it must be confessed that now and then there was a sort
of equivocal remark made by him, as though he had some faint recollection
of his former profession, although he evinced not the smallest sense of
shame at the change which had been wrought in him. Indeed this trifling
imperfection in the change of identity appears to have attended such
transformations in general, and might have arisen from the individual
bodies retaining their own clothes (for the mere fashion of dress hath a
great influence on some minds), or, perhaps, because a profession or
trade, with the habits thereof, cannot be entirely shaken off, nor a new
one perfectly learned, by spinning a teetotum for five minutes. The time
had now arrived when George Syms, the shoemaker, and Peter Brown, the
blacksmith, were accustomed to take their &ldquo;pint and pipe after dinner,&rdquo;
 and greatly were they surprised to see their places so occupied; and not a
little was their astonishment increased, when the parson lifted up his
voice, and ordered Sally to bring out a couple of chairs, and then shook
them both warmly by the hand, and welcomed them by the affectionate
appellation of &ldquo;my hearties!&rdquo;

<p>
He then winked, and in an under tone began to sing&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m tied to a crusty old woman,
Much given to scolding and jealousy,
I know that the case is too common,
And so I will ogle each girl I see.
Toi de roi, loi, &amp;c.
</pre>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, my lads!&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;sit you down, and clap half a yard of clay
into your mouths.&rdquo; The two worthy artisans looked at each other
significantly, or rather insignificantly, for they knew not what to think,
and did as they were bid. &ldquo;Come, why don&rsquo;t you talk?&rdquo; said the teetotum
parson landlord, after a short silence. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as dull as a couple of tom
cats with their ears cut off&mdash;talk, man, talk&mdash;there&rsquo;s no doing
nothing without talking.&rdquo; This last part of his speech seemed more
particularly addressed to Peter Brown, who, albeit a man of a sound head,
and well skilled in such matters as appertained unto iron and the coal
trade, had not been much in the habit of mixing with the clergy; therefore
he felt, for a moment, as he said, &ldquo;nonplushed;&rdquo; but fortunately he
recollected the Catholic question, about which most people were then
talking, and which every body professed to understand. Therefore, he
forthwith introduced the subject; and being well aware of the parson&rsquo;s
bias, and having, moreover, been told that he had written a pamphlet;
therefore (though to do Peter Brown justice, he was not accustomed to read
such publications) he scrupled not to give his opinion very freely, and
concluded by taking up his pint and drinking a very unchristian-like
malediction against the Pope. George Syms followed on the same side, and
concluded in the same manner, adding thereunto, &ldquo;Your good healths,
gemmen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What a pack of nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the parson, &ldquo;I should
like to know what harm the Pope can do us! I tell you what, my lads, it&rsquo;s
all my eye and Betty Martin. Live and let live, I say. So long as I can
get a good living, I don&rsquo;t care the toss of a halfpenny who&rsquo;s uppermost.
The Pope&rsquo;s an old woman, and so are they that are afraid of him.&rdquo; The
elderly stranger here seemed highly delighted, and cried, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and
clapped the speaker on the back, and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your sort! Go it, my
hearty!&rdquo; But Peter Brown took the liberty of telling the parson, in a very
unceremonious way, that he seemed to have changed his opinions very
suddenly. &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;I was always of the same way of
thinking.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then words have no meaning,&rdquo; observed George Syms,
angrily, &ldquo;for I heard you myself. You talked as loud about the wickedness
of &lsquo;mancipation as ever I heard a man in my life, no longer ago than last
Sunday.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then I must have been drunk&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I can say
about the business,&rdquo; replied the other, coolly; and he began to fill his
pipe with the utmost nonchalance, as though it was a matter of course.
Such apparently scandalous conduct was, however, too much for the
unsophisticated George Syms and Peter Brown, who simultaneously threw down
their reckoning, and, much to their credit, left the turncoat reprobate
parson to the company of the elderly gentleman.
</p>
<p>
If we were to relate half the whimsical consequences of the teetotum
tricks of this strange personage, we might fill volumes; but as it is not
our intention to allow the detail to swell even into one, we must hastily
sketch the proceedings of poor Jacob Philpot, after he left the Red Lion
to dine with sundry of the gentry and clergy of the Old Boar, in his new
capacity of an ecclesiastic, in the outward form of a somewhat negligently
dressed landlord. He was accosted on the road by divers of his
coal-carrying neighbours with a degree of familiarity which was
exceedingly mortifying to his feelings. One told him to be home in time to
take part of a gallon of ale that he had won of neighbour Smith; a second
reminded him that to-morrow was club-night at the Nag&rsquo;s Head; and a third
asked him where he had stolen his horse. At length he arrived, much out of
humour, at the Old Boar, an inn of a very different description from the
Red Lion, being a posting house of no inconsiderable magnitude, wherein
that day was to be holden the symposium of certain grandees of the
adjacent country, as before hinted.
</p>
<p>
The landlord, who happened to be standing at the door, was somewhat
surprised at the formal manner with which Jacob Philpot greeted him, and
gave his horse into the charge of the hostler; but, as he knew him only by
sight, and had many things to attend to, he went his way without making
any remark, and thus, unwittingly, increased the irritation of Jacob&rsquo;s new
teetotum sensitive feelings. &ldquo;Are any of the gentlemen come yet?&rdquo; asked
Jacob, haughtily, of one of the waiters.&mdash;&ldquo;What gentlemen?&rdquo; quoth the
waiter. &ldquo;Any of them,&rdquo; said Jacob, &ldquo;Mr. Wiggins, Doctor White, or Captain
Pole?&rdquo; At this moment a carriage drove up to the door, and the bells all
began ringing, and the waiters rah to see who had arrived, and Jacob
Philpot was left unheeded.&mdash;&ldquo;This is very strange conduct!&rdquo; observed
he; &ldquo;I never met with such incivility in my life! One would think I was a
dog!&rdquo; Jacob walked into the open air to cool himself, and strolled round
the garden of the inn, till the calls of hunger forced him to return to
the house, where the odour of delicate viands was quite provoking; so he
followed the guidance of his nose, and arrived in the large dining-room,
where he found, to his great surprise and mortification, that the company
were assembled, and the work of destruction had been going on for some
time, as the second course had just been placed on the table. Jacob felt
that the neglect with which he had been treated was &ldquo;enough to make a
parson swear;&rdquo; and perhaps he would have sworn, but that he had no time to
spare and, therefore, as all the seats at the upper end of the table were
engaged, he deposited himself on a vacant chair about the centre, between
two gentlemen with whom he had no acquaintance, and, spreading his napkin
on his lap, demanded of a waiter what fish had gone out. The man replied
only by a stare and a smile, a line of conduct which was by no means
surprising, seeing that the most stylish part of Philpot&rsquo;s dress was,
without dispute, the napkin aforesaid. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fellow gaping at?&rdquo;
 cried Jacob, in an angry voice; &ldquo;go and tell your master I want to speak
to him directly. I don&rsquo;t understand such treatment. Tell him to come
immediately! Do you hear?&rdquo; The loud tone in which this was spoken aroused
the attention of the company; and most of them cast a look of inquiry,
first at the speaker, and then round at the table, as if to discern by
whom the strange gentleman in the scarlet and yellow plush waistcoat and
the dirty shirt might be patronized but there were others who recognized
the landlord of the Red Lion at Stockwell. The whole, however, were
somewhat startled when he addressed them as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Really,
gentlemen, I must say, that a joke may be carried too far; and, if it was
not for my cloth (here he handled the napkin), I declare I don&rsquo;t know how
I might act. Mr. Chairman, we have known each other now for a good many
years, and you must be convinced that I can take a joke as well as any
man; but human nature can endure this no longer. Mr. Wiggins! Captain
Pole! my good friend Doctor White! I appeal to you.&rdquo; Here the gentlemen
named looked especially astounded. &ldquo;What! can it be possible that you have
<i>all</i> agreed to cut me! Oh, no! I will not believe that political
differences of opinion can run <i>quite</i> so high. Come&mdash;let us
have no more of this nonsense!&rdquo;&mdash;No, no, we&rsquo;ve had quite enough of
it,&rdquo; said the landlord of the Old Boar, pulling the chair from beneath the
last speaker, who was consequently obliged again to be upon his legs,
while there came, from various parts of the table, cries of &ldquo;Chair! chair!
Turn him out!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; roared the teetotum par-soned landlord of the
Red Lion, to the landlord of the Old Boar, &ldquo;Man! you shall repent of this!
If it wasn&rsquo;t for my cloth, I&rsquo;d soon-&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Come, give me the cloth!&rdquo;
 said the other, snatching away the napkin, which Jacob had buttoned in his
waistcoat, and thereby causing that garment to fly open and expose more of
dirty linen and skin than is usually sported at a dinner party. Poor
Philpot&rsquo;s rage had now reached its acme, and he again appealed to the
chairman by name. &ldquo;Colonel Martain!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can you sit by and see me
used thus? I am sure that you will not pretend that you don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
I,&rdquo; replied the chairman; I know you well enough, and a confounded
impudent fellow you are. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my lad, next time you apply
for a license, you shall hear of this.&rdquo; The landlord of the Old Boar was,
withal, a kind-hearted man; and, as he knew that the loss of its license
would be ruin to the rampant Red Lion and all concerned therewith, he was
determined that poor Philpot should be saved from destruction in spite of
his teeth; therefore, without further ceremony, he, being a muscular man,
laid violent hands upon the said Jacob, and, with the assistance of his
waiters conveyed him out of the room, in despite of much struggling, and
sundry interjections concerning his &ldquo;cloth.&rdquo; When they had deposited him
safely in an armchair in &ldquo;the bar,&rdquo; the landlady, who had frequently seen
him before, in his proper character, that of a civil man, who &ldquo;knew his
place&rdquo; in society, very kindly offered him a cup of tea; and the landlord
asked how he could think of making such a fool of himself; and the waiter,
whom he had accosted on first entering the house, vouched for his not
having had any thing to eat or drink; whereupon they spoke of the remains
of a turbot, which had just come down stairs, and a haunch of venison that
was to follow. It is a sad thing to have a mind and body that are no match
for each other. Jacob&rsquo;s outward man would have been highly gratified at
the exhibition of these things; but the spirit of the parson was too
mighty within, and spurned every offer, and the body was compelled to
obey. So the horse that was borrowed of the squire was ordered out, and
Jacob Philpot mounted and rode on his way in excessive irritation,
growling vehemently at the insult and indignity which had been committed
against the &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; in general, and his own person in particular.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The sun sunk beneath the horizon,&rdquo; as novelists say, when Jacob Philpot
entered the village of Stockwell, and, as if waking from a dream, he
suddenly started, and was much surprised to find himself on horseback, for
the last thing that he recollected was going up stairs at his own house,
and composing himself for a nap, that he might be ready to join neighbour
Scroggins and Dick Smith, when they came in the evening to drink the
gallon of ale lost by the latter. &ldquo;And, my eyes!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I haven&rsquo;t
got the squire&rsquo;s horse that the parson borrowed this morning. Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s
very odd! however, the ride has done me a deal of good, for I feel as if I
hadn&rsquo;t any thing all day, and yet I did pretty well too at the leg of
mutton at dinner.&rdquo; Mrs. Philpot received her lord and nominal master in no
very gracious mood, and said she should like to know where he had been
riding. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I can tell you,&rdquo; replied Jacob; &ldquo;however, I know
I&rsquo;m as hungry as a greyhound, though I never made a better dinner in my
life.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;More shame for you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Philpot; &ldquo;I wish the Old Boar
was a thousand miles off.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the woman talking about?&rdquo; quoth
Jacob. &ldquo;Eh! what! at it again, I suppose,&rdquo; and he pointed to the closet
containing the rum bottle. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Philpot, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the parson
coming down stairs!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The parson!&rdquo; exclaimed Jacob; what&rsquo;s he been
doing up stairs, I should like to know?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He has been to take a nap
on mistress&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; said Sally.&mdash;&ldquo;The dickens he has! This is a
pretty story,&rdquo; quoth Jacob. &ldquo;How could I help it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Philpot;
&ldquo;you should stay at home and look after your own business, and not go
ramshackling about the country. You shan&rsquo;t hear the last of the Old Boar
just yet I promise you.&rdquo; To avoid the threatened storm, and satisfy the
calls of hunger, Jacob made off to the larder, and commenced an attack
upon the leg of mutton.
</p>
<p>
At this moment the Reverend Mr. Stanhope opened the little door at the
foot of the stairs&mdash;On waking, and finding himself upon a bed, he
concluded that he must have fainted in consequence of the agitation of
mind produced by the gross insults which he had suffered, or perhaps from
the effects of hunger. Great, therefore, was his surprise to find himself
at the Red Lion in his own parish; and the first questions he asked of
Mrs. Philpot were, how and when he had been brought there. &ldquo;La, Sir!&rdquo; said
the landlady, &ldquo;you went up stairs of your own accord, after you were tired
of smoking under the tree.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Smoking under the tree, woman!&rdquo;
 exclaimed Mr. Stanhope; &ldquo;what are you talking about? Do you recollect whom
you are speaking to?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ay, marry, do I,&rdquo; replied the sensitive Mrs.
Philpot; &ldquo;and you told Sally to call you when Scroggins and Smith came for
their gallon of ale, as you meant to join their party.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Reverend Mr. Stanhope straightway took up his hat, put it upon his
head, and stalked with indignant dignity out of the house, opining that
the poor woman was in her cups; and meditated as he walked home, on the
extraordinary affairs of the day. But his troubles were not yet ended, for
the report of his public jollification had reached his own household; and
John, his trusty man-servant, had been dispatched to the Red Lion, and had
ascertained that his master was really gone to bed in a state very unfit
for a clergyman to be seen in. Some remarkably good-natured friends had
been to condole with Mrs. Stanhope upon the extraordinary proceedings of
her good man, and to say how much they were shocked, and what a pity it
was, and wondering what the bishop would think of it, and divers other
equally amiable and consolatory reflections and notes of admiration.&mdash;Now
Mrs. Stanhope, though she had much of the &ldquo;milk of human kindness&rdquo; in her
composition, had, withal, a sufficient portion of &ldquo;tartaric acid&rdquo; mingled
therewith. Therefore, when her beer-drinking husband made his appearance,
he found her in a state of effervescence. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;I am extremely
fatigued. I have been exposed to-day to a series of insults, such as I
could not have imagined it possible for any one to offer me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor any body else,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Stanhope; &ldquo;but you are rightly served,
and I am glad of it. Who could have supposed that you, the minister of a
parish?&mdash;Faugh! how filthily you smell of tobacco! I vow I cannot
endure to be in the room with you!&rdquo; and she arose and left the divine to
himself, in exceeding great perplexity. However, being a man who loved to
do all things in order, he remembered that he had not dined, so he rang
the bell and gave the needful instructions, thinking it best to satisfy
nature first, and <i>then</i> endeavour to ascertain the cause of his
beloved Mary&rsquo;s acidity. His appetite was gone but that he attributed to
having fasted too long, a practice very unusual with him; however, he
picked a bit here and there, and then indulged himself with a bottle of
his oldest port, which he had about half consumed, and somewhat recovered
his spirits, ere his dear Mary made her re-appearance, and told him that
she was perfectly astonished at his conduct.&mdash;And well might she say
so, for <i>now</i> the wine, which he had been drinking with unusual
rapidity, thinking, good easy man, that he had taken nothing all day,
began to have a very visible effect upon a body already saturated with
strong ale. He declared that he cared not a fig for the good opinion of
any gentleman in the county; that he would always act and speak according
to his principles, and filled a bumper to the health of the Lord
Chancellor, and drank sundry more exceedingly loyal toasts; and told his
astonished spouse, that he should not be surprised if he was very soon to
be made a dean or a bishop; and as for the people at the Old Boar, he saw
through their conduct&mdash;it was all envy, which doth &ldquo;merit as its
shade pursue.&rdquo; The good lady justly deemed it folly to waste her oratory
upon a man in such a state, and reserved her powers for the next morning;
and Mr. Stanhope reeled to bed that night in a condition which to do him
justice, he had never before exhibited under his own roof.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, Mrs. Stanhope and her daughter Sophy, a promising young
lady about ten years old, of the hoyden class, were at breakfast, when the
elderly stranger called at the rectory, and expressed great concern on
being told that Mr. S. was somewhat indisposed, and had not yet made his
appearance. He said that his business was of very little importance, and
merely concerned some geological inquiries, which he was prosecuting in
the vicinity; but Mrs. Stanhope, who had the names of all the ologies by
heart, and loved occasionally to talk thereof, persuaded him to wait a
short time, little dreaming of the consequence; for the wily old gentleman
began to romp with Miss Sophy, and, after a while, produced his teetotum,
and, in short, so contrived it, that the mother and daughter played
together therewith for five minutes. He then politely took his leave,
promising to call again; and Mrs. Stanhope bobbed him a curtsey, and
Sophia assured him that Mr. S. would be extremely happy to afford him
every assistance in his scientific researches. When the worthy divine at
length made his appearance in the breakfast parlour, strangely puzzled as
to the extreme feverishness and langour which oppressed him, he found
Sophy sitting gravely in an arm-chair, reading a treatise on craniology.
It was a pleasant thing for him to see her read any thing; but he could
not help expressing his surprise, by observing, &ldquo;I should think that book
a little above your comprehension, my dear.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed! Sir,&rdquo; was the
reply; and the little girl laid down the volume, and sat erect in her
chair, and thus continued:&mdash;&ldquo;I should think, Mr. Nicodemus Stanhope,
that after the specimen of good sense and propriety of conduct which you
were pleased to exhibit yesterday, it scarcely becomes <i>you</i> to
pretend to estimate the <i>comprehension</i> of others.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;
 said the astonished divine, &ldquo;this is very strange language! You forget
whom you are speaking to!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;I know
<i>my</i> place, if you don&rsquo;t know yours, and am determined to speak my
mind.&rdquo; If anything could add to the Reverend Mr. Nicodemus Stanhope&rsquo;s
surprise, it was the sound of his wife&rsquo;s voice in the garden, calling to
his man John to stand out of the way, or she should run over him. Poor
John, who was tying up some of her favourite flowers, got out of her way
accordingly in quick time, and the next moment his mistress rushed by,
trundling a hoop, hallooing and laughing, and highly enjoying his apparent
dismay. Throughout that day, it may be imagined that the reverend
gentleman&rsquo;s philosophy was sorely tried; and we are compelled, by want of
room, to leave the particulars of his botheration to the reader&rsquo;s
imagination.
</p>
<p>
We are sorry to say that these were not the only metamorphoses which the
mischievous old gentleman wrought in the village of Stockwell.
</p>

There was a game of teetotum played between a sergeant of dragoons, who
had retired upon his well-earned pension, and a baker, who happened
likewise to be the renter of a small patch of land adjoining the village.
The veteran, with that indistinctness of character before mentioned,
shouldered the peel, * and took it to the field, and used it for loading
and spreading manure, so that it was never afterwards fit for any but
dirty work. Then, just to show that he was not afraid of any body, he cut
a gap in the hedge of a small field of wheat which had just been reaped,
and was standing in sheaves, and thereby gave admittance to a neighbouring
bull, who amused himself greatly by tossing the said sheaves; but more
particularly those which were set apart as tythes, against which he
appeared to have a particular spite, throwing them high into the air, and
then bellowing and treading them under foot. But&mdash;we must come to a
close. Suffice it to say, that the village of Stockwell was long in a
state of confusion in consequence of these games; for the mischief which
was done during the period of delusion, ended not, like the delusion
itself, with the rising or setting of the sun.

Having now related as many particulars of these strange occurrences as our
limits will permit, we have merely to state the effects which they
produced upon ourselves. Whenever we have since beheld servants aping the
conduct of their masters or mistresses, tradesmen wasting their time and
money at taverns, clergymen forgetful of the dignity and sacred character
of their profession, publicans imagining themselves fit for preachers,
children calling their parents to account for their conduct, matrons
acting the hoyden, and other incongruities&mdash;whenever we witness these
and the like occurrences, we conclude that the actors therein have been
playing a game with the Old Gentleman&rsquo;s Teetotum.

<h2>
A WATER PARTY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Oh, Laura! such a charming party!
You&rsquo;ve missed our pic-nic, foolish girl;
I do assure you from my heart,
I Hate you, now you&rsquo;re Mrs. Searle.

You know I dote upon the river&mdash;
‘Twas settled we should row to Kew;
And though the cold did make us shiver,
In England that&rsquo;s not very new.

But I should tell you that our number
Was rather more than you would like;
For Ma would ask that living lumber,
That dull, but worthy, Mrs. Pike:

Then <i>she</i> insisted that her daughter
Could not, for worlds, be left behind;
The poor girl screamed so, on the water&mdash;
I wonder mothers are so blind!

We&rsquo;d Clara Smith, and Major Morris,
Besides Sir John, and Lady Gann&mdash;
Their nephew too&mdash;his name is Horace&mdash;
A well-bred, clever, tall young man:

Papa, Mamma, and all my brothers&mdash;
Sophia, Kate, Georgina, and me;
I have not time to name the others,
Except your old flame, Dr. Lea.

The whole arrangement was quite charming;
Miss Smith, though, is a shocking flirt;
Her conduct really was alarming&mdash;
Her Mamma is so very pert.

The men all chose to praise her singing!
But one&rsquo;s so sick of &ldquo;Home, sweet Home!&rdquo;
 And &ldquo;Hark, the Village Bells are ringing!&rdquo;
 Is duller than the Pope of Rome.

Then her &ldquo;La ci darem la mano,&rdquo;
 Was murdered by poor Major M.;
She whispered him, in vain, &ldquo;<i>piano!</i>&rdquo;
 That little man is quite a gem&mdash;

I mean to those who&rsquo;re fond of quizzing,
Which you and I, of course, are not;
He looks like soda-water, fizzing,
Or like a mutton-chop when hot.

The doctor offered to be funny&mdash;
That is, to sing a comic song;
But what it was, for love or money,
I cannot tell&mdash;it was so long.

He gave us too, a &ldquo;recitation&rdquo;&mdash;
To me a most enormous bore;
My brother muttered, &ldquo;botheration!&rdquo;
 My father wished him at the Nore.

We all had clubbed to take provision,
And meant to dine in some one&rsquo;s field;
Old Pike opposed this said decision&mdash;
His wife, however, made him yield.

But when, at last, we&rsquo;d fairly landed,
And spread our cloth upon the ground,
(If you won&rsquo;t laugh, I will be candid),
We found our dinner almost drowned!

Champagne and claret&mdash;every bottle
Had cracked, and deluged fowls and ham
But yet it had not spoiled the &ldquo;tottle&rdquo;&mdash;
There still was pigeon-pie and lamb.

With cider, porter, port and sherry,
We managed vastly well to dine:
In spite of all, we were so merry&mdash;
But still the weather was not fine.

In fact, before we finished dinner,
There was a kind of Scottish mist;
And had our dresses been much thinner,
It might have made us somewhat triste.

But good stout silk is now the fashion&mdash;
My green one, though, was sadly spoiled;
Mamma flew into such a passion!
I could not help its being soiled.

We owe, however, to the shower
An unexpected source of mirth;
For, when the sky began to pour,
The men proposed a snugger berth:

Instead of getting wet by rowing,
They voted to return by land;
We all agreed, without well knowing
How we should ever reach the Strand.

Just while we wisely were debating,
An Omnibus appeared in sight,
Which quickly settled all our prating,
And very much to my delight:

Yet this machine could scarcely carry
The whole of four-and-twenty friends;
But, as it would not do to tarry,
We popped in all the odds and ends.

Such an odd, facetious journey!
We went so fast&mdash;&lsquo;twas Jike a dream!
The coachman, quite another Gurney,
Only without that worthy&rsquo;s steam.

In short, the whole was most delightful&mdash;
We wanted nothing, dear, but you;
And now, my paper being quite full,
I&rsquo;ll only add&mdash;adieu!&mdash;adieu!

THE ANGLER AND THE FOWLER.

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here the new-breeched urchin stands on the low bridge of the little bit
burnie! and with crooked pin, baited with one unwrithing ring of a dead
worm, and attached to a yarn-thread, for he has not yet got into hair, and
is years off gut, his rod of the mere willow or hazel wand, there will he
stand during all his play-hours, as forgetful of his primer as if the
weary art of printing had never been invented, day after day, week after

heart-mind-and-soul engrossing hope of some time or other catching a minow

<p>
A tug&mdash;a tug! with face ten times flushed and pale by turns ere you
could count ten, he at last has strength, in the agitation of his fear and
joy, to pull away at the monster&mdash;and there he lies in his beauty
among the gowans on the greensward, for he has whapped him right over his
head and far away, a fish a quarter of an ounce in weight, and, at the
very least, two inches long! Off he flies, on wings of wind, to his
father, mother, and sisters, and brothers, and cousins, and all the
neighbourhood, holding the fish aloft in both hands, still fearful of its
escape, and, like a genuine child of corruption, his eyes brighten at the
first blush of cold blood on his small fishy-fumy fingers. He carries
about with him, up stairs and down stairs, his prey upon a plate; he will
not wash his hands before dinner, for he exults in the silver scales
adhering to the thumbnail, that scooped the pin out of the baggy&rsquo;s maw&mdash;and
at night, &ldquo;cabin&rsquo;d, cribb&rsquo;d, confined,&rdquo; he is overheard murmuring in his
sleep, a thief, a robber, and a murderer, in his yet infant dreams!
</p>
<p>
From that hour Angling is no more a mere delightful day-dream, haunted by
the dim hopes of imaginary minnows, but a reality&mdash;an art&mdash;a
science&mdash;of which the flaxen headed school-boy feels himself to be
master&mdash;a mystery in which he has been initiated, and off he goes
now, all alone, in the power of successful passion, to the distant brook&mdash;brook
a mile off&mdash;with fields, and hedges, and single trees, and little
groves, and a huge forest of six acres, between him and the house in which
he is boarded or was born! There flows on the slender music of the shadowy
shallows&mdash;there pours the deeper din of the birch-tree&rsquo;d waterfall.
The sacred water-pyet flits away from stone to stone, and dipping,
disappears among the airy bubbles, to him a new sight of joy and wonder.
And oh! how sweet the scent of the broom or furze, yellowing along the
braes, where leap the lambs, less happy than he, on the knolls of
sunshine! His grandfather has given him a half-crown rod, in two pieces&mdash;yes,
his line is of hair twisted&mdash;platted by his own soon instructed
little fingers. By heavens, he is fishing with the fly! and the Fates,
who, grim and grisly as they are painted to be by full-grown, ungrateful,
lying poets, smile like angels upon the padler in the brook, winnowing the
air with their wings into western breezes, while at the very first throw,
the yellow trout forsakes his fastness beneath the bog-wood, and with a
lazy wallop, and then a sudden plunge, and then a race like lightning,
changes at once the child into the boy, and shoots through his thrilling
and aching heart the ecstacy of a new life expanding in that glorious
pastime, even as a rainbow on a sudden brightens up the sky. <i>Fortuna
favet fortibus</i>&mdash;and with one long pull, and strong pull, and pull
altogether, Johnny lands a twelve incher on the soft, smooth, silvery sand
of the only bay in all the burn where such an exploit was possible, and
dashing upon him like an Osprey, soars up with him in his talons to the
bank, breaking his line as he hurries off to a spot of safety, twenty
yards from the pool, and then flinging him down on a heath-surrounded plat
of sheep-nibbled verdure, lets him bounce about till he is tired, and lies
gasping with unfrequent and feeble motions, bright and beautiful, and
glorious with all his yellow light and crimson lustre, spotted, speckled,
and starred in his scaly splendour, beneath a sun that never shone before
so dazzlingly; but now the radiance of the captive creature is dimmer and
obscured, for the eye of day winks and seems almost shut behind that slow
sailing mass of clouds, composed in equal parts of air, rain, and
sunshine.
</p>
<p>
Springs, summers, autumns, winters,&mdash;each within itself longer, by
many times longer than the whole year of grown up life, that slips at last
through one&rsquo;s fingers like a knotless thread,&mdash;pass over the curled
darling&rsquo;s brow, and look at him now, a straight and strengthy stripling,
in the savage spirit of sport, springing over rock-ledge after rock-ledge,
nor heeding aught as he splashes knee-deep, or waist-band high, through
river-feeding torrents, to the glorious music of his running and ringing
reel after a tongue-hooked salmon, insanely seeking with the ebb of tide,
but all in vain, the white breakers of the sea. No hazel or willow wand,
no half-crown rod of ash framed by village wright, is now in his practised
hands, of which the very left is dexterous: but a twenty feet rod of
Phin&rsquo;s, all ring-rustling, and a-glitter with the preserving varnish,
limber as the attenuating line itself, and lithe to its topmost tenuity as
the elephant&rsquo;s proboscis&mdash;the hiccory and the horn without twist,
knot, or flaw, from butt to fly, a faultless taper, &ldquo;fine by degrees, and
beautifully less.&rdquo; the beau ideal of a rod by the skill of a cunning
craftsman to the senses materialised! A fish-fat, fair, and forty! &ldquo;She is
a salmon, therefore to be woo&rsquo;d&mdash;she is a salmon, therefore to be
won&rdquo;&mdash;but shy, timid, capricious, headstrong, now wrathful, and now
full of fear, like any other female whom the cruel artist has hooked by
lip or heart, and, in spite of all her struggling, will bring to the gasp
at last, and then with calm eyes behold her lying in the shade dead, or
worse than dead, fast-fading and to be reillumined no more the lustre of
her beauty, insensible to sun or shower, even the most perishable of all
perishable things in a world of perishing!&mdash;But the salmon has grown
sulky, and must be made to spring to the plunging stone. There, suddenly,
instinct with new passion, she shoots out of the foam, like a bar of
silver bullion; and, relapsing into the flood, is in another moment at the
very head of the water-fall! Give her the butt&mdash;give her the butt&mdash;or
she is gone for ever with the thunder into ten fathom deep! Now comes the
trial of your tackle&mdash;and when was Phin ever known to fail at the
edge of cliff or cataract? Her snout is southwards&mdash;right up the
middle of the main current of the hill-born river, as if she would seek
its very course where she was spawned! She still swims swift, and strong,
and deep&mdash;and the line goes, steady, boys, steady&mdash;stiff and
steady as a Tory in the roar of opposition. There is yet an hour&rsquo;s play in
her dorsal fin&mdash;danger in the flap of her tail&mdash;and yet may her
silver shoulder shatter the gut against a rock. Why, the river was
yesterday in spate, and she is fresh run from the sea. All the lesser
waterfalls are now level with the flood, and she meets with no impediment
or obstruction&mdash;the course is clear&mdash;no tree-roots here&mdash;no
floating branches, for during the night they have all been swept down to
the salt loch&mdash;<i>in medio tutissimus ibis</i>&mdash;ay, now you feel
she begins to fail&mdash;the butt tells now every time you deliver your
right. What! another mad leap! yet another sullen plunge! She seems
absolutely to have discovered, or rather to be an impersonation of the
Perpetual Motion. Stand back out of the way, you son of a sea-cook&mdash;you
in the tattered blue breeches, with the tail of your shirt hanging out.
Who the devil sent you all here, ye vagabonds?&mdash;Ha! Watty Richie, my
man, is that you? God bless your honest laughing phiz! What Watty, would
you think of a Fish like that about Peebles? Tam Grieve never gruppit sae
heavy a ane since first he belanged to the Council. Curse that colley! Ay!
well done Watty! Stone him to Stobbo. Confound these stirks&mdash;if that
white one, with caving horns, kicking heels, and straight up tail, come
bellowing by between me and the river, then, &ldquo;Madam! all is lost, except
honour!&rdquo; If we lose this Fish at six o&rsquo;clock, then suicide at seven. Our
will is made&mdash;ten thousand to the Foundling&mdash;ditto to the Thames
Tunnel-ha&mdash;ha&mdash;my beauty! Methinks we could fain and fond kiss
thy silver side languidly lying afloat on the foam, as if all farther
resistance now were vain, and gracefully thou wert surrendering thyself to
death No faith in female&mdash;she trusts to the last trial of her tail&mdash;sweetly
workest thou, O Reel of Reels! and on thy smooth axle spinning sleep&rsquo;st,
even, as Milton describes her, like our own worthy planet.
</p>
<p>
Scrope&mdash;Bainbridge&mdash;Maule&mdash;princes among Anglers&mdash;oh!
that you were here! Where the devil is Sir Humphrey? At his retort? By
mysterious sympathy&mdash;far off at his own Trows, the Kerss feels that
we are killing the noblest Fish, whose back ever rippled the surface of
deep or shallow in the Tweed. Tom Purdy stands like a seer, entranced in
glorious vision, beside turreted Abbotsford. Shade of Sandy Givan! Alas!
alas! Poor Sandy&mdash;why on thy pale face that melancholy smile!&mdash;Peter!
The Gaff! The Gaff! Into the eddy she saüs, sick and slow, and almost with
a swirl&mdash;whitening as she nears the sand&mdash;there she has it&mdash;struck
right into the shoulder, fairer than that of Juno, Diana, Minerva, or
Venus&mdash;fair as the shoulder of our own beloved, and lies at last in
all her glorious length and breadth of beaming beauty, fit prey for giant
or demi-god angling before the Flood!
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The child is father of the man,
And I would wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
So much for the Angler. The Shooter again, he begins with his pop or pipe
gun, formed of the last year&rsquo;s growth of a branch of the plane-tree&mdash;the
beautiful dark-green-leaved and fragrant-flowered plane-tree, that stands
straight in stem and round in head, visible and audible too from afar the
bee-resounding umbrage, alike on stormy sea-coast and in sheltered inland
vale, still loving the roof of the fisherman&rsquo;s or peasant&rsquo;s cottage.
</p>
<p>
Then comes, perhaps, the city popgun, in shape like a very musket, such as
soldiers bear&mdash;a Christmas present from parent&mdash;once a Colonel
of volunteers&mdash;nor feeble to discharge the pea-bullet or barley-shot,
formidable to face and eyes; nor yet unfelt, at six paces, by hinder end
of play-mate, scornfully yet fearfully exposed. But the shooter soon tires
of such ineffectual trigger&mdash;and his soul, as well as his hair, is
set on fire by that extraordinary compound&mdash;Gunpowder. He begins with
burning off his eyebrows on the King&rsquo;s birth-day&mdash;squibs and crackers
follow&mdash;and all the pleasures of the pluff. But he soon longs to let
off a gun&mdash;&ldquo;and follows to the field some warlike lord&rdquo;&mdash;in
hopes of being allowed to discharge one of the double-barrels, after Ponto
has made his last point, and the half-hidden chimneys of home are again
seen smoking among the trees. This is his first practice in fire-arms, and
from that hour he is&mdash;a Shooter.
</p>
<p>
Then there is in most rural parishes&mdash;and of rural parishes alone do
we condescend to speak&mdash;a pistol, a horse one, with a bit of silver
on the butt&mdash;perhaps one that originally served in the Scots Greys.
It is bought, or borrowed, by the young shooter, who begins firing, first
at barn doors, then at trees, and then at living things&mdash;a strange
cur, who, from his lolling tongue, may be supposed to have the hydrophobia&mdash;a
cat that has purred herself asleep on the sunny church-yard wall, or is
watching mice at their hole-mouths among the graves&mdash;a water-rat in
the mill-lead&mdash;or weasel that, running to his retreat in the wall,
always turns round to look at you&mdash;a goose wandered from his common
in disappointed love&mdash;or brown duck, easily mistaken by the
unscrupulous for a wild one, in pond, remote from human dwelling, or on
meadow by the river side, away from the clack of the muter mill. The corby
crow, too, shouted out of his nest on some tree lower than usual, is a
good flying mark to the more advanced class, or morning magpie, a-chatter
at skreigh of day close to the cottage door among the chickens, or a flock
of pigeons wheeling over head on the stubble-field, or sitting so thick
together that every stook is blue with tempting plumage.
</p>
<p>
But the pistol is discharged for a fowling piece&mdash;brown and rusty,
with a slight crack, probably in the muzzle, and a lock, out of all
proportion, to the barrel. Then the young shooter aspires at half-pennies
thrown up into the air&mdash;and generally hit, for there is never wanting
an apparent dent in copper metal; and thence he mounts to the glancing and
skimming swallow, a household bird, and therefore to be held sacred, but
shot at on the excuse of its being next to impossible to hit him, an
opinion strengthened into belief by several summers&rsquo; practice. But the
small brown and white marten wheeling through below the bridge, or along
the many holed red sand bank, is admitted by all boys to be fair game&mdash;and
still more, the long-winged legless black devilet, that, if it falls to
the ground, cannot rise again and therefore screams wheeling round the
corners and battlements of towers and castles, or far out even of
cannon-shot, gambols in companies of hundreds, and regiments of a
thousand, aloft in the evening ether, within the orbit of the eagle&rsquo;s
flight. It seems to boyish eyes, that the creatures near the earth, when
but little blue sky is seen between the specks and the wall-flowers
growing on the coign of vantage&mdash;the signal is given to fire, but the
devilets are too high in heaven to smell the sulphur. The starling whips
with a shrill cry into his nest, and nothing falls to the ground but a
tiny bit of mossy mortar, inhabited by a spider!
</p>
<p>
But the Day of Days arrives at last, when the school-boy&mdash;or rather
the college boy returning to his rural vacation&mdash;for in Scotland,
college winters tread close&mdash;too close&mdash;on the heels of
academies&mdash;has a gun&mdash;a gun in a case&mdash;a double barrel too&mdash;of
his own&mdash;and is provided with a license&mdash;probably without any
other qualification than that of hit or miss. On some portentous morning
he effulges with the sun, in velveteen jacket and breeches of the same&mdash;many-buttoned
gaiters, and an unkerchiefed throat. Tis the fourteenth of September, and
lo! a pointer at his heels&mdash;Ponto of course&mdash;a game bag like a
beggar&rsquo;s wallet by his side&mdash;destined to be at eve as full of charity&mdash;and
all the paraphernalia of an accomplished sportsman. Proud, were she to see
the sight, would be the mother that bore him the heart of that old
sportsman, his daddy, would leap for joy! The chained mastiff in the yard
yowls his admiration, the servant lassies uplift the pane of their garret,
and, with suddenly withdrawn blushes, titter their delight in their rich
paper curls and pure night-clothes. Rab Roger, who has been cleaning out
the barn, comes forth to partake of the caulker, and away go the footsteps
of the old poacher and his pupil through the autumnal rime, off to the
uplands, where&mdash;for it is one of the earliest of harvests, there is
scarcely a single acre of standing corn. The turnip-fields are bright
green with hope and expectation&mdash;and coveys are couching on lazy beds
beneath the potatoe shaw. Every high hedge, ditch-guarded on either side,
shelters its own brood&mdash;imagination hears the whirr shaking the
dew-drops from the broom on the brae&mdash;and first one bird and then
another, and then the remaining number, in itself no contemptible covey,
seems to fancy&rsquo;s ear to spring single, or in clouds, from the coppice
brushwood, with here and there an intercepting standard tree.
</p>
<p>
Poor Ponto is much to be pitied.&mdash;Either having a cold in his nose,
or having ante-breakfasted by stealth on a red herring, he can scent
nothing short of a badger; and, every other field, he starts in horror,
shame, and amazement, to hear himself, without having attended to his
points, inclosed in a whirring covey. He is still duly taken between those
inexorable knees; out comes the speck and span new dog-whip, heavy enough
for a horse; and the yowl of the patient is heard over the whole parish.
Mothers press their yet unchastised infants to their breasts; and the
schoolmaster, fastening a knowing eye on dunce and ne&rsquo;er-do-well, holds
up, in silent warning, the terror of the tawse. Frequent flogging will cow
the spirit of the best man and dog in Britain. Ponto travels now in fear
and trembling, but a few yards from his tyrant&rsquo;s feet, till, rousing
himself to the sudden scent of something smelling strongly, he draws
slowly and beautifully, and
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;There fixed, a perfect semi-circle stands.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Up runs the Tyro, ready-cocked, and in his eagerness, stumbling among the
stubble, when mark and lo! the gabble of grey goslings, and the
bill-protruded hiss of goose and gander! Bang goes the right-hand barrel
at Ponto, who now thinks it high time to be off, to the tune of &ldquo;ower the
hills and far away,&rdquo; while the young gentleman, half ashamed and half
incensed, half glad, and half sorry, discharges the left-hand barrel, with
a highly improper curse, at the father of the feathered family before him,
who receives the shot like a ball in his breast, throws a somerset, quite
surprising for a bird of his usual habits, and after biting the dust with
his bill, and thumping it with his bottom, breathes an eternal farewell to
this sublunary scene&mdash;and leaves himself to be paid for, at the rate
of eight-pence a pound to his justly irritated owner, on whose farm he had
led a long, and not only harmless, but honourable and useful life.
</p>
<p>
It is nearly as impossible a thing as we know, to borrow a dog about the
time the Sun has reached his meridian, on the First day of the Partridges.
Ponto by this time has sneaked, unseen by human eye, into his kennel, and
coiled himself up into the arms of tired Nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer, balmy
sleep. A farmer makes offer of a colley, who from numbering among his
paternal ancestors a Spanish pointer, is quite a Don in his way among the
chirpers, and has been known in a turnip-field to stand in an attitude
very similar to that of setting. Luath has no objection to a frolic over
the fields, and plays the part of Ponto to perfection. At last he catches
sight of a covey basking, and leaping in upon them, open-mouthed,
dispatches them right and left, even like the famous dog Billy, killing
rats in the pit at Westminster. The birds are bagged, with a gentle
remonstrance, and Luath&rsquo;s exploit rewarded with a whang of cheese. Elated
by the pressure on his shoulder, the young gentleman laughs at the idea of
pointing, and fires away, like winking, at every uprise of birds, near or
remote; works a miracle by bringing down three at a time, that chanced,
unknown to him, to be crossing; and wearied with such slaughter, lends his
gun to the attendant farmer, who can mark down to an inch, and walks up to
the dropped pout, as if he could kick her up with his foot; and thus the
bag in a few hours is half full of feathers, while to close with eclat the
sport of the day, the cunning elder takes him to a bramble bush, in a wall
nook, at the edge of a wood, and returning the gun into his hands, shows
him poor pussie sitting with open eyes fast asleep! The pellets are in her
brain, and turning herself over, she crunkles out to her full length, like
a piece of untwisting Indian rubber, and is dead. The posterior pouch of
the jacket, yet unstained by blood, yawns to receive her&mdash;and in she
goes plump, paws, ears, body, feet, fud and all&mdash;while Luath, all the
way home to the Mams, keeps snoking at the red drops oozing through&mdash;for
well he knows in summer&rsquo;s heat and winter&rsquo;s cold, the smell of pussie,
whether sitting beneath a tuft of withered grass on the brae, or burrowed
beneath a snow wreath. A hare, we certainly must say, in spite of
haughtier sportsman&rsquo;s scorn is, when sitting, a most satisfactory shot.
</p>
<p>
But let us trace no further, thus step by step, the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.
Look at him now,&mdash;a finished sportsman&mdash;on the moors&mdash;the
bright black boundless Dalwhinnie Moors, stretching away, by long
Lock-Erricht-side, into the dim and distant day that hangs, with all its
clouds, over the bosom of far Loch-Rannoch. Is that the pluffer at
partridge pouts who had nearly been the death of poor Ponto? Lord Kennedy
himself might take a lesson now from the straight and steady style in
which, on the mountain brow, and up to the middle in heather, he brings
his Manton to the deadly level! More unerring eye never glanced along
brown barrel! Finer forefinger never touched a trigger! Follow him a whole
day, and not one wounded bird. All most beautifully arrested on their
flight by instantaneous death! Down dropped, right and left, like lead on
the heather&mdash;old cock and hen singled out among the orphan&rsquo;s brood,
as calmly as a cook would do it in the larder&mdash;from among a pile of
plumage. No random shot within&mdash;no needless shot out of distance&mdash;covered
every feather before stir of finger&mdash;and body, back, and brain,
pierced, broken, scattered! And what perfect pointers! There they stand,
still as death&mdash;yet instinct with life&mdash;the whole half-dozen&mdash;Mungo,
the black-tanned&mdash;Don, the red-spotted&mdash;Clara, the snow-white&mdash;Primrose,
the pale yellow&mdash;Basto, the bright brown, and Nimrod, in his coat of
many colours, often seen afar through the mists like a meteor.

<h2>
THE ELOPEMENT.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the banks of the rivulet Lockwitz, in Hungary, and upon the borders of
Thuringia, where a convent formerly stood, which was destroyed in the time
of the Hussites, is situated the Castle of Lauenstein. This church
property, in process of time, came under the secular arm, and became the
possession of the Count of Orlamunda, who gave this deserted domain as a
feu to one of his vassals, who, upon the ruins of the convent, built
himself a castle, and either gave his name to the property, or took his
from it, for he was called the Baron of Lauenstein.
</p>
<p>
It soon became manifest that the property of the church does not prosper
in the hands of the laity, and that such sacrilege is always punished in
one way or another. The bones of the holy nuns, which for ages had reposed
in peace in the gloomy caverns of the grave, could not, with indifference,
endure this profanation of their sanctuary. These mouldy dead bones
rebelled against the violation, rattled and rustled in the silence of
night, and raised a fearful clattering and noise in the passage leading to
the church, which had not been destroyed. The nuns, with solemn pomp,
often made a procession round the castle, wandered through the apartments,
opened and dashed to the doors, by which the Baron was disturbed in his
sleep, and could not get rest in his bed. They raged in the hall, or in
the stables, terrified the maids, twitched and pinched them, sometimes
here, sometimes there;&mdash;plagued the cattle&mdash;the cows were
drained of their milk, and the horses pranced and snorted, and beat their
stalls to pieces. This mischievous behaviour of the pious sisters, and
their incessant tricks, which embittered the life of both man and beast,
touk away all spirit from every member of the household, down to the very
bull-dog.

The Baron spared no expense, by means of the most renowned exorcists, to
bring these tumultuary inmates to peace and silence; but the most powerful
exorcisms, before which the whole kingdom of Belial trembled, and the
sprinkling brush dipped in holy water, which generally chases away the
evil spirits, as a fly-flap chases away the flies from the apartment, for
a long time could do nothing against the obstinacy of those spectre
Amazons, who so stoutly maintained their right to their former
possessions, that the exorcists, with the holy implements of relics, were
sometimes obliged to take to flight, and leave them masters of the field.
At last, a conjuror, who was travelling about the country for the purpose
of spying out witches, catching goblins, and delivering the possessed from
the brood of evil spirits, succeeded in bringing the spectral night
revellers to obedience, and again shut them up in their gloomy vaults,
with permission there to wag their skulls, and rattle and clatter their
bones, as much as they pleased.
</p>
<p>
All was now quiet in the Castle, the nuns again slept the still sleep of
death; but, after seven years, one unquiet sister spirit again awoke, and
once more made her appearance in the night, and for some time continued
her former pranks, until she tired, then rested seven years, and then paid
another visit to the upper world, and re-visited the Castle. In time, the
family became accustomed to the apparition; only, when the period of her
appearance approached, the domestics took care to avoid the passage
through which she was to come, and kept close to their apartments.
</p>
<p>
After the decease of the first possessors, the inheritance fell to the
next in descent, and there never had failed a male heir, until the time of
the thirty years&rsquo; war, when the last branch of the Lauensteins flourished:
in whose production nature appeared to have exhausted her power. So lavish
had she been of the stuff which composed his body, that at the period when
it had reached its highest perfection, so enormous was his size, that he
weighed nearly as much as the far-famed Franz Finatzie of Presburg, and
his corpulence was only a few inches less than that of the well-fed
Holstener, known by the name of Paul Butterbread, who formerly exhibited
himself as a show to Parisian belles. However, Baron <i>Sieg</i> mund was
a very stately man till this period, when his body resembled a tun; he
lived well, and though he did not waste the inheritance of his fathers, he
spared himself none of the enjoyments of life. No sooner had his
progenitors made way for him, and he found himself in possession of
Lauenstein, than, after the manner of his fathers, he married, and at the
end of a year, he became a father; but, alas! it was of a girl, and as he
had no hopes of succeeding children, with this he was forced to be
content. The thrifty mother, who at her marriage took charge of the
domestic concerns, now commenced the education of her daughter. The more
papa&rsquo;s paunch gained the upper hand, the more obtuse became his mind, till
at length the Baron took no notice of anything, except what was either
roasted or boiled.
</p>
<p>
From the accumulation of family affairs, Fraulein Emily was, for the most
part, left to the care of mother Nature, and thereby found herself never
the worse. This secret artist, who does not like to put her reputation at
stake, and generally makes up by a master-stroke, for any error she
commits, had better proportioned the body and talents of the daughter than
those of the father&mdash;she was beautiful, clever, and witty. As the
charms of the young Fraulein expanded, the views of the mother increased,
and she resolved, that through her the splendour of their expiring race
should again be restored. The lady possessed a secret pride which was not
remarked in the common occurrences of life, except in regard to her
pedigree, which she considered the most glorious ornament of their house;
and so high were her pretensions, that, except the family of the Counts of
Reiuss, there was no race in Hungary sufficiently ancient and noble, into
which she would choose to transplant the last blossom of the Lauenstein
stem. And much as the young gentlemen in the neighbourhood wished to
secure the rich prize, the crafty mother always contrived to frustrate
their intentions. She watched the heart of the Fraulein with as much care
as a customhouse officer does the harbour, lest any contraband goods
should slip through; overturned every speculation of match-making aunts
and cousins; and had such high expectations for her daughter, that no
young man ventured to approach her. As long as the heart of a maiden
listens to advice, it resembles a boat upon the calm unruffled sea, which
sails wherever the rudder directs it; but when the winds and waves arise
and rock the light bark, it no longer obeys the helm, but follows the
current of the stream.
</p>
<p>
So it was with the tractable Emily, who willingly allowed herself to be
led on in the path of pride by the maternal leading-strings, for her still
unsophisticated heart was susceptible of every impression. She at least
expected a Prince or Count to do homage to her charms; and any less high
born paladins who paid their court to her, were repulsed with cold
disdain. But before a suitable adorer could be found for the Lauenstein
Grace, a circumstance occurred which disappointed all the matrimonial
schemes of the mother; and such were its effects, that, had all the
princes and counts of the Roman and German empire sued for the heart and
hand of the fair Fraulein, they would have found themselves too late.
</p>
<p>
In the troubled times of the thirty years&rsquo; war, the army of the braye
Wallenstein came into Hungary for winter quarters, and Baron Siegmund
received many uninvited guests into the castle, who did more mischief than
the former hobgoblins; for, although they had even less right to the
property than the former, no sorcerer could exorcise them away. The
proprietor saw himself forced to put a good face on this wicked game, for
the purpose of keeping these commanding gentlemen in good humour, and so
induce them to keep up proper discipline in the castle. Banquets and balls
succeeded each other without intermission; at the first the lady presided,
at the latter the daughter. And whenever the military band began to play
the accompanying favourite waltz, it was the signal for the gallant Fritz
to lead the fair Emily to the dance These splendid feasts made the rough
warriors more pliant: they respected the house which had so hospitably
entertained them, and guests and host were satisfied with each other.
</p>
<p>
Among these warriors there were many young heroes, who might even have
tempted limping Vulcan&rsquo;s beautiful helpmate to become unfaithful. But
there was one in particular who eclipsed them all. A young officer, called
the handsome Fritz, had the appearance of a helmed god of love. To an
elegant figure, this young Apollo joined the most engaging manners; he was
gentle, modest, agreeable, of a lively disposition and, above all, a
charming dancer. Until this moment no one had made the slightest
impression on the heart of Emily, but this youth raised in her innocent
bosom a new sensation, which filled her soul with inexpressible delight.
</p>
<p>
But the wonder was, that this enchanting Adonis was neither called the
handsome Count, nor the handsome Prince, but neither more nor less than
the handsome Fritz. She interrogated his brother officers, one after
another, about the young man&rsquo;s name and descent, but no one could
enlighten her upon the subject. All praised the handsome Fritz as a brave
man, and a good officer, and who possessed the most amiable character, but
at the same time it appeared that all was not right in regard to his
pedigree. There were as many reports of his birth as of that of the well
known and enigmatical Count Cagliostro, who was sometimes said to be the
descendant of the Grand Master of Malta, and by the maternal side, nephew
to the Grand Seignior; sometimes the son of a Neapolitan coachman, then a
full brother of Zannowichs, pretended Prince of Albania, and by profession
a worker of miracles; and then it was rumoured that he was a wig-maker.
All these reports arose from the handsome Fritz having raised himself from
the pike to the sash, and all agreed, that, should fortune again favour
him, he would reach the highest situations in the army. The secret
inquiries of the inquisitive Emily were not long concealed from the object
of them. His companions thought to flatter him with the intelligence, and
generally accompanied it with all sorts of favourable conjectures. His
modesty attributed her advances to jest and mockery; nevertheless, the
inquiries of the young damsel pleased him well, for the first look had
inspired him with an ecstasy, which is the usual harbinger of love.
</p>
<p>
No language possesses such energy, and is likewise so well understood, as
the sweet feeling of sympathy; through the operation of which, a first
acquaintance sooner rises into love than one can rise from the pike to the
sash.
</p>
<p>
Some time elapsed before the lovers came to a verbal explanation, but they
were aware of each other&rsquo;s sentiments, their looks met half-way, and said
what timid love dared not disclose. From the uproar in the house, the
negligent mother had, at a very wrong season, removed the watch over the
heart of her beloved daughter; and seeing this important post unoccupied,
the crafty smuggler, Love, seized his opportunity, and secretly stole in.
No sooner had he obtained possession, than he taught the Fraulein quite a
different lesson from mamma. The sworn enemy of all ceremony, he
immediately removed the prejudices of his obedient scholar, and soon
taught her to think, that birth and rank were not to be put in competition
with all-conquering Love, and that lovers should not be classed, like
beetles and worms, in a collection of insects.
</p>
<p>
The frosty pride of ancestry melted as quickly in her soul as the figures
upon a frozen window dissolve when the rays of the sun begin to warm the
atmosphere; till at length Emily cared not whether her lover had pedigree
or not, and she even carried her political heresy so far as to maintain,
that the prerogatives of high birth, in comparison with love, were the
most insufferable yoke with which the freedom of mankind had ever been
burthened.
</p>
<p>
The handsome Fritz, who adored the Fraulein, with joy perceived that his
fortune in love was as propitious as his fortune in war. He seized the
first opportunity which offered of disclosing the situation of his heart.
She received his declaration with blushes, but with inward delight, and
the lovers exchanged vows of inviolable fidelity. They enjoyed the present
moment, but shuddered at the future. The return of spring again called the
army into tents, and the sorrowful moment approached which was to separate
the lovers. They now held a serious consultation on ratifying their vows
of love, so as that nothing but death could part them. The Fraulein
acquainted her lover with the sentiments of her mother on the subject of
marriage; and that it was not to be expected that the proud lady would
deviate one hair&rsquo;s-breadth from her darling system, to sanction a union of
affection.
</p>
<p>
A hundred plans were adopted and rejected, for with each there was always
some difficulty in the way which rendered its success doubtful. Meanwhile
the young hero found his betrothed determined to take any course which
would accomplish their wishes; upon which he proposed an elopement, as the
surest way which love had yet thought of, which has succeeded innumerable
times, and which will succeed in destroying the plans of parents, and in
vanquishing their obstinacy. Emily considered for a little, and then
consented; one thing was still to be considered, how she would escape from
the walls and bulwarks of the castle, to throw herself into the arms of
the welcome robber; for well she knew the moment that the Wallenstein
garrison marched out of the castle, the vigilant mother would again take
possession of her post, and her steps would be so watched she would never
be allowed to go out of her sight. But inventive Love conquers every
difficulty. It was well known to the Fraulein, that, according to
tradition, on All-soul&rsquo;s Day, in the approaching autumn, the Spectre Nun,
after a lapse of seven years, would again revisit the castle. The terror
of the inmates at the expectation of her appearance was also well known to
her; she therefore determined upon the bold freak of playing the nun&rsquo;s
part. Accordingly she secretly prepared a nun&rsquo;s dress, and under this
disguise resolved to elope.
</p>
<p>
The handsome Fritz was delighted with this invention, and although the
time of the thirty years&rsquo; war was too early for freethinking, yet the
young officer was enough of a philosopher to doubt the existence of
spirits, or at least to trouble himself very little about the matter.
</p>
<p>
Their plans being thus arranged, Fritz threw himself into his saddle, and,
commending himself to the protection of Love, departed at the head of his
squadron. It appeared that Love had heard his prayer, for, although he
exposed himself to all dangers, the campaign terminated most prosperously,
and he escaped unhurt. Meanwhile Emily lived between hope and fear; she
trembled for the life of her faithful Amadis&mdash;she sought diligently
to obtain intelligence how it went with them in the field. Every new
rumour of a skirmish put her in terror and anxiety, which her mother took
for the sign of a feeling heart, without its creating any suspicion. The
hero let no opportunity slip of privately corresponding with his beloved,
and through the channel of a trusty waiting-maid, he from time to time
gave her intelligence of his fate, and through the same messenger received
accounts from her. As soon as the campaign was ended, he prepared every
thing for his secret expedition, bought four steeds and a travelling
carriage, and looked carefully in the Calendar for the day on which he was
to be at the appointed place of meeting, in the little grove, not far from
the castle. On All-soul&rsquo;s Day, Emily, with the assistance of her
attendant, prepared to carry her plan into execution. As had been agreed
upon, she feigned herself a little indisposed, and retired early to her
apartment, where she immediately transformed herself into the prettiest
hobgoblin that had ever haunted the earth. The evening hours, by Emily&rsquo;s
calculation, seemed to have doubled themselves, and, as she thought of the
work she had in hand, every moment increased her wish to accomplish her
adventure. Meanwhile the pale Luna, the secret friend of lovers, with her
soft glimmer, shone on the castle of Lauenstein, in which the tumult of
the busy day was by degrees lost in the solemn stillness of the night.
None were awake in the castle but the housekeeper, who sat late in the
night calculating the expenses of the kitchen&mdash;the capon-stuffer, who
was plucking for the breakfast of the household a score of larks&mdash;the
porter, who had also the office of watchman, and called out the hours, and
Hector, the vigilant house-dog, who with his howls bayed the rising moon.
</p>
<p>
As the midnight hour sounded, the intrepid Emily set out upon her way. She
had provided herself with a master-key which opened all the doors. Softly
and secretly she descended the steps that led through the cloister, in
crossing which she observed there was still a light in the kitchen. Upon
this she rattled her bunch of keys with all her might, dashed to the doors
with a deafening noise, and boldly opened the house-door and the wicket
without accident. As soon as the four waking inmates of the castle heard
this unusual noise, they looked for the appearance of the roving Nun. The
capon-stuffer, terrified, fled into a closet; the housekeeper into bed;
the watchdog into his kennel; and the porter into the straw beside his
wife. The Fraulein soon arrived in the open field, and hastened to the
grove, where she thought she saw at a distance the carriage and fleet
horses waiting her appearance. But on a nearer approach she discovered it
was only the deceitful shadow of a tree. From this she concluded she had
mistaken the place of appointment. She crossed and recrossed the shrubbery
from one end to another, but her knight, with his equipage, was nowhere to
be found. Astonished at this circumstance, she knew not what to think.
</p>
<p>
After an appointed rendezvous, not to appear, is considered among lovers a
high misdemeanour, but in the present case to fail, was little less than
high treason against Love; the thing was to her incomprehensible. After
having waited, but in vain, for an hour long, and her heart trembling from
anxiety and cold, she began to wail and weep. &ldquo;Ah! the perfidious one,&rdquo;
 she exclaimed, &ldquo;he lies in the arms of some coquette, from whom he cannot
tear himself away; he mocks me, and has forgot my true-love.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This thought suddenly brought the long-forgotten pedigree to her
recollection, and she felt ashamed of having so far demeaned herself as to
love a man without a name, or noble feeling. In this moment when the
intoxication of passion had somewhat subsided, and reason had resumed her
sway, this faithful counsellor advised her to re deem this false step, by
immediately returning to the castle, and trying to forget the false
perjurer. The first she did, without delay; and, to the great surprise of
her faithful confidant, to whom she revealed every thing, she reached her
chamber safe and sound; but the second point she resolved to reflect upon
at leisure.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the man without a name, was not so much to blame as the
enraged Emily supposed. He had not failed to be punctual at the place of
meeting. With a heart full of rapture, he waited with impatience for the
moment which was to put him in possession of his lovely treasure. As the
midnight hour approached, he secretly hastened to the castle, and listened
when the little gate would open. Sooner than he supposed possible, the
beloved figure of the nun stepped out. He immediately rushed from his
concealment towards her, seized her in his arms, exclaiming, &ldquo;I have thee&mdash;I
hold thee. Never shall I leave thee. Dear love, thou art mine&mdash;I am
thine, with body and soul.&rdquo; Joyfully he bore his lovely burden to the
carriage, and soon they rattled over stocks and stones, up hills and down
vallies. The horses plunged and snorted, shook their manes, and became so
wild and unmanageable, that they would no longer obey the reins. A wheel
flew off, and the sudden shock precipitated the coachmen to the ground;
and carriage and horses, and man and mouse, all rolled over a steep abyss
into a gulf below. The fond lover knew not what had happened; his body was
bruised, his head was crushed, and, from the severity of the fall, he lost
all recollection; but when he came to himself, he missed his beloved
companion. After spending the rest of the night in this helpless
situation, he was found by some peasants in the morning, who carried him
to the nearest village.
</p>
<p>
The carriage was dashed to pieces, the four horses had broken their necks.
This loss, however, grieved him little; but the fate of the beautiful
Emily plunged him in the greatest distress. He despatched people in every
direction to try and gain some tidings of her; but they all returned as
they went, nothing was to be heard of the runaway. The midnight hour was
the first thing which cleared up this mystery. As the clock struck twelve,
the door opened, and his lost travelling companion stepped into the
apartment, not however in the form of the beautiful Emily, but of the
Spectre Nun, a hideous skeleton. The handsome Fritz, with horror,
perceived that he himself had made this dreadful mistake. Death-cold
perspirations burst over him; he began to cross and bless himself, and
ejaculate every prayer he could think of.
</p>
<p>
The nun little heeded this; she stepped up to the bed, stroked his burning
cheeks with her withered ice-cold hand, and said, &ldquo;Fritz, Fritz, be
resigned to it I am thine&mdash;thou art mine, with body and soul&rdquo; She
thus continued to torture him with her presence for an hour, and then
vanished. This game she acted every night, and she even followed him into
the place where his regiment was quartered. He had neither peace nor
repose from the love of this hobgoblin, which so grieved and fretted him,
that he lost all spirit; so much so, that his companions began to remark
his deep melancholy; and these gallant officers truly sympathized with his
distress. They could not imagine what had happened to their former lively
associate, for he carefully shunned the horrible secret, which he divulged
to no one.
</p>
<p>
Among his companions, Fritz had one very intimate friend, whom rumour
reported master of all magical arts, and who possessed the lost art of
making himself invulnerable, could call up spirits, and had every day a
free shot. This experienced warrior, with affectionate impatience, urged
his friend to disclose the secret grief which so evidently oppressed him.
This martyr of love, who was sick of his existence, at length, under the
seal of secrecy, was prevailed on to divulge it. &ldquo;Brother, is this all?&rdquo;
 said the exorcist, with a smile; &ldquo;I shall soon release you from this
torment.&mdash;Follow me into my quarters.&rdquo; He began by making secret
preparations, drew several circles and characters upon the floor, and, at
the summons of the exorcist, in a dark chamber which was lighted only by a
magician&rsquo;s lamp, the midnight guest for this time appeared at the mid-day
hour. He scolded her very much, and banished her and her mischievous
pranks to a hollow willow in a lonely valley, with strict commands at that
very hour to set out to this Patmos.
</p>
<p>
The spectre vanished, but at the same moment there arose such a storm and
whirlwind, as set the whole town in commotion. It was an old pious custom
when a high wind blew, that twelve deputed citizens should instantly take
horse, and make a solemn pilgrimage through the streets, chanting a song
of repentance to sing the wind away. As soon as the twelve booted and
well-mounted apostles had rode out, the howling voice of the hurricane
ceased, and the spirit never again appeared. * Fritz now perceived that
this devilish ape&rsquo;s play was intended to entrap his poor soul, and was
rejoiced that the tormenting spirit had left him. He again prepared to
join the formidable Wallenstein in Pomerania, where he finished three
campaigns without hearing anything of the lovely Emily, and behaved with
such bravery, that on his return to Bohemia, he commanded a regiment of
horse. He took his way through Hungary, and when he came in sight of the
Castle of Lauenstein, his heart began to beat with anxiety and doubt lest,
in his absence, his beloved had been forgetful of him. He merely announced
himself as a friend of the family, and, according to the rites of
hospitality, gates and doors were soon thrown open to him. We may mention
here, that it is still the custom in this town for this wind-laying
cavalcade to perambulate the streets during a storm.
</p>
<p>
Ah! how astonished was the lovely Emily, when her supposed faithless
lover, the handsome Fritz, stepped into the apartment! Joy and anger by
turns assailed her soul. She could not resolve to vouchsafe him one
friendly look, and yet this league with her beautiful eyes cost her the
greatest difficulty.
</p>
<p>
For three long years she had debated with herself whether she would
forget, or not, her nameless, and, as she believed, faithless lover, and
therefore he was never one moment from her thoughts. His image floated
continually before her; and, besides, it appeared that the God of Dreams
was his patron, for the innumerable dreams that the Fraulein had of him
ever since his absence, either excused or defended him. The stately
Colonel, whose high rank the harsh survey of the mother somewhat softened,
soon found an opportunity to try the apparent coldness of his beloved. He
related to her the horrible adventure of the Elopement, and she frankly
acknowledged to him the pain the thoughts of his faithlessness had given
her. The lovers now agreed to reveal their secret to mamma, and endeavour
to prevail with her to favour their attachment.
</p>
<p>
The good lady was as much astonished at the secret attachment of the
cunning Emily, as at the communication of the <i>species facti</i> of the
Elopement. She thought it just that love, which had stood so severe a
trial, should be rewarded. It was only the man without a name that was
offensive to her; and as the Fraulein observed, that it was incomparably
more sensible to marry a man without a name, than a name without a man,
against this argument she had nothing to reply.
</p>
<p>
They were married, and as the secret treaty had already prospered, and no
Count lay at the bottom of her heart, the good dame gave her maternal
consent to it. The handsome Fritz embraced his lovely bride, and quietly
and happily accomplished his marriage, without the slightest interruption
on the part of the Spectre Nun.

<h2>
SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ubjects of conversation are sometimes exceedingly difficult to be had. I
have known many a company of well dressed men and women feel themselves
most awkwardly situated for want of something to talk about. The weather,
which is said to be a never failing subject, cannot hold out above a few
minutes at a time. It will stand a round or two rounds, but not more. It
is then knocked up for the evening, and cannot with decency be again
brought forward. Being thus disposed of, the subject of &ldquo;news&rdquo; is tabled;
but, as a matter of course, there being &ldquo;no news stirring,&rdquo; &ldquo;not a word,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;nothing in the papers,&rdquo; that subject is also soon dispatched. If there
happen to be any very remarkable occurrence worth talking of, what a
blessing it is on such occasions! It is food for the company a whole
night, and may be again and again brought above board for their amusement.
But it much more frequently happens that there is no exciting event to
talk about, and then the condition of the company is truly miserable.
There being ladies present, or there being two factions in the room,
politics are proscribed; and even if they could be brought forward, the
question of reform immediately comes in with all its tiresomeness, and is
put down by general consent. Every attempt at getting up a topic failing,
the company look into the fire, or in each others faces, or begin to
examine with much interest the pattern of the carpet; and the silence
which ensues is truly terrific. A slight whisper is the only sound in the
apartment, and is caught at or watched by the company, for it may chance
to be the commencement of a conversation in which they may join, without
exciting particular attention. But it, too, dies away. It was only a
passing under-current of remark between the two married ladies in the blue
and white turbans, on the dearth of coals, the difficulty of getting good
servants, or the utility of keeping children muffled in flannel nightgowns
from October till March. At length some good soul makes an effort to brush
away his diffidence. He projects a remark across the room towards the
little man with the smirking countenance, about Mr. This, or Miss That, or
Signor Such-a-thing, who are at present enlivening the town with their
exhibitions. The remark is in itself a very ordinary remark, but it has
its use; it quickens the intellects of those who hear it, and the tongues
of a number of individuals are set a-going upon the subject of theatrical
amusements, singing in the Assembly Rooms, Pasta, Paganini, and private
parties, so that the original remark is lost sight of, and the company go
on pretty well with what it has produced, for perhaps half an hour. All
these topics being exhausted, another horrible silence ensues. The company
again look into the fire, or in one another&rsquo;s faces, and once more examine
the carpet. What is to be said next? All think upon saying something, yet
nobody speaks. The national <i>mauvaise honte</i> is now displayed to the
height of its perfection. The agony of the company, however, approaches
its crisis.&mdash;The awful stillness is broken, and in a most natural and
unexpected manner. The young man in the starched cravat sitting in the
corner of the room, near the end of the piano, who has been thinking what
he shall say or do for the last half hour, takes heart of grace; he rises
and snuffs the candles, going through the self-imposed duty in as neat and
elegant a style as he can possibly affect. The snuffing of the candles is
an operation which every member of the company has seen performed ten
thousand times; but it affords interest for even the ten thousandth and
first time. It may not intrinsically be worth heeding, yet in a case of
this nature, it is of very great importance. It suggests a new theme, and
that is exactly what is wanted, for one subject invariably leads to the
discussion of half a dozen others. The operation of snuffing the candles
therefore induces some one to remark, how beautiful gas light is. Then
this brings on a disquisition on the danger of introducing it into private
houses; ils cost in comparison with oil is next touched upon; then follows
an observation about the last illumination; which leads to reminiscences
of similar displays on the occasions of the great naval victories&mdash;the
victories lead to Nelson&mdash;Nelson to his biographer, Southey&mdash;Southey,
to poetry&mdash;poetry, to Byron&mdash;and Byron, to Greece. This whirl of
conversation, however, also runs out; an accident jars it, and it is all
over. Suddenly the speakers pause, as if they had received a galvanic
shock; one small voice is alone left prominent above the silence; but
finding itself unsupported, it is immediately lowered to a whisper, and
the whisper subsides to a dead silence.
</p>
<p>
I have often pitied the host or hostess on occasions of this nature; but I
could not help blaming them for not providing against such dismal pauses
in the conversation of the parties. To guard against these occurrences, I
would recommend them to bring forward what I have remarked to be
never-failing sources of conversational entertainment, namely, a tolerably
good-looking cat, a lap-dog or a child. The last is the best, it ought to
be about two years of age, and be able to walk. If adroitly played off, or
permitted to play, it will amuse the party for an hour at least. It must
be placed on the hearth-rug, so as to attract all eyes; and while in the
room, no other subject of discourse will be thought of. Any endeavour to
draw off attention, by the relation of some entertaining anecdote, will be
deemed sedition against the majesty of the household. If a cat, a dog, or
an interesting child, cannot be conveniently had, I would advise the
invitation of some one who has a loud voice and the happy effrontery of
speaking incessantly, however ridiculously, on all subjects; a person who
can speak nonsense to any extent, and has the reputation of being a most
agreeable companion. This man is of vast use in tabling subjects; for he
has no diffidence or modesty, and has a knack of turning every observation
to account. His voice also serves as a cover to much bye conversation;
there being hundreds who speak fluently enough, provided a bag-pipe were
kept playing beside them, or who could have their voices drowned by some
other species of noise. The loud and voluble talker is therefore an
excellent shelter for those of weaker nerves, and will be found a useful
ingredient in all mixed companies.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty of starting subjects of conversation, as well as the
difficulty of sustaining them, is often as observable when two
acquaintances meet in the street, as when a roomful of company is
collected. The unhappy pair exhaust all that they can remember they ought
to say to each other, in the space of a minute and a half, and another
minute may be consumed in going through the process of taking a pinch of
snuff; the next half minute is spent in mutual agony. Neither knows how to
separate. As the only chance of release, one of the parties at last brings
in a joke, or what is meant to be such, to his aid. The other, of course,
feels bound to laugh, and both seizing the opportunity, escape in
different directions under cover of the witticism.

<h2>
INCONVENIENCIES RESULTING FROM BEING HANGED.
</h2>
<h3>
&ldquo;TO THE EDITOR OF THE REFLECTOR.&rdquo; *
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ir,&mdash;I am one of those unhappy persons whose misfortunes, it seems,
do not entitle them to the benefit of pure pity. All that is bestowed upon
me of that kindest alleviator of human miseries, comes dashed with a
double portion of contempt. My griefs have nothing in them that is felt as
sacred by the bystanders. Yet is my affliction, in truth, of the deepest
grain. The heaviest task that was ever given to mortal patience to
sustain. Time, that wears out all other sorrows, can never modify or
soften mine. Here they must continue to gnaw.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* London, 1810.
</pre>
<p>
Why was I ever born? Why was innocence in my person suffered to be branded
with a stain which was appointed only for the blackest guilt? What had I
done, or my parents, that a disgrace of mine should involve a whole
posterity in infamy? I am almost tempted to believe, that, in some
preexistent state, crimes to which this sublunary life of mine hath been
as much a stranger as the babe that is newly born into it, have drawn down
upon me this vengeance, so disproportionate to my actions on this globe.
</p>
<p>
My brain sickens, and my bosom labours to be delivered of the weight that
presses upon it, yet my conscious pen shrinks from the avowal. But out it
must&mdash;
</p>
<p>
O, Mr. Reflector! guess at the wretch&rsquo;s misery who now writes this to you,
when, with tears and burning blushes, he is obliged to confess, that he
has been&mdash;<b>Hanged</b>-
</p>
<p>
Methinks I hear an involuntary exclamation burst from you, as your
imagination presents to you fearful images of your correspondent, unknown,&mdash;<i>hanged!</i>
</p>
<p>
Fear not, Mr. Editor. No disembodied spirit has the honour of addressing
you. I am flesh and blood, an unfortunate system of bones, muscles,
sinews, arteries, like yourself.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then, I presume, you mean to be pleasant. That expression of yours, Mr.
Correspondent, must be taken somehow in a metaphorical sense</i>.
</p>
<p>
In the plainest sense, without trope or figure. Yes, Mr. Editor, this neck
of mine has felt the fatal noose,&mdash;these hands have tremblingly held
up the corroborative prayer-book,&mdash;these lips have sucked the
moisture of the last consolatory orange,&mdash;this tongue has chaunted
the doleful cantata which no performer was ever called upon to repeat,&mdash;this
face has had the veiling night-cap drawn over it.
</p>
<p>
But for no crime of mine. Far be it from me to arraign the justice of my
country, which, though tardy, did at length recognize my innocence. It is
not for me to reflect upon the judge or jury, now that eleven years have
elapsed since the erroneous sentence was pronounced. Men will always be
fallible, and perhaps circumstances did appear at the time a little strong&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say, that after hanging four minutes,&mdash;(as the
spectators were pleased to compute it,&mdash;a man that is being
strangled, I know from experience, has altogether a different measure of
time from his friends who are breathing leisurely about him, I suppose the
minutes lengthen as time approaches eternity, in the same manner as the
miles get longer as you travel northward),&mdash;after hanging four
minutes, according to the best calculation of the bystanders, a reprieve
came, and I was cut down&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Really, I am ashamed of deforming your pages with these technical phrases,
if I knew how to express my meaning shorter&mdash;
</p>
<p>
But to proceed.&mdash;My first care, after I had been brought to myself by
the usual methods (those methods that are so interesting to the operator
and his assistants, who are pretty numerous on such occasions, but which
no patient was ever desirous of undergoing a second time for the benefit
of science), my first care was to provide myself with an enormous stock or
cravat, to hide the place&mdash;you understand me; my next care was to
procure a residence as distant as possible from that part of the country
where I had suffered. For that reason I chose the metropolis as the place
where wounded honour (I had been told) could lurk with the least danger of
exciting enquiry, and stigmatised innocence had the best chance of hiding
her disgrace in a crowd. I sought out a new circle of acquaintance, and my
circumstances happily enabling me to pursue my fancy in that respect, I
endeavoured, by mingling in all the pleasures which the town affords, to
efface the memory of what I had undergone.
</p>
<p>
But alas! such is the portentous and all-pervading chain of connection
which links together the head and members of this great community, my
scheme of lying <i>perdu</i> was defeated almost at the outset. A
countryman of mine, whom a foolish lawsuit had brought to town, by chance
met me, and the secret was soon blazoned about.
</p>
<p>
In a short time, I found myself deserted by most of those who had been my
intimate friends. Not that any guilt was supposed to attach to my
character. My officious countryman, to do him justice, had been candid
enough to explain my perfect innocence. But, somehow or other, there is a
want of strong virtue in mankind. We have plenty of the softer instincts,
but the heroic character is gone. How else can I account for it, that of
all my numerous acquaintance, among whom I had the honour of ranking
sundry persons of education, talents, and worth, scarcely here and there
one or two could be found, who had the courage to associate with a man
that had been hanged.
</p>
<p>
Those few who did not desert me altogether, were persons of strong but
coarse minds; and from the absence of all delicacy in them, I suffered
almost as much as from the super-abundance of a false species of it in the
others. Those who stuck by me were the jokers, who thought themselves
entitled, by the fidelity which they had shown towards me, to use me with
what familiarity they pleased. Many and unfeeling are the jests that I
have suffered from these rude (because faithful) Achateses. As they passed
me in the streets, one would nod significantly to his companion and say,
pointing to me, smoke his cravat, and ask me if I had got a wen, that I
was so solicitous to cover my neck. Another would enquire, what news from
* * * Assizes? (which you may guess, Mr. Editor, was the scene of my
shame) and whether the sessions was like to prove a maiden one? A third
would offer to ensure me from drowning. A fourth would teaze me with
enquiries how I felt when I was swinging, whether I had not something like
a blue flame dancing before my eyes? A fifth took a fancy never to call me
any thing but <i>Lazarus</i>. And an eminent bookseller and publisher,
who, in his zeal to present the public with new facts, had he lived in
those days, I am confident, would not have scrupled waiting upon the
person himself last mentioned, at the most critical period of his
existence, to solicit a <i>few facts relative to resuscitation</i>, had
the modesty to offer me&mdash;guineas per sheet, if I would write, in his
Magazine, a physiological account of my feelings upon coming to myself.
</p>
<p>
But these were evils which a moderate fortitude might have enabled me to
struggle with. Alas! Mr. Editor, the women,&mdash;whose good graces I had
always most assiduously cultivated, from whose softer minds I had hoped a
more delicate and generous sympathy than I found in the men,&mdash;the
women began to shun me&mdash;this was the unkindest blow of all.
</p>
<p>
But is it to be wondered at? How couldest thou imagine, wretched est of
beings, that that tender creature Seraphina would fling her pretty arms
about that neck which previous circumstances had rendered infamous? That
she would put up with the refuse of the rope, the leavings of the cord? Or
that any analogy could subsist between the knot which binds true lovers,
and the knot which ties malefactors.
</p>
<p>
I can forgive that pert baggage Flirtilla, who, when I complimented her
one day on the execution which her eyes had done, replied, that to be
sure, Mr. * * was a judge of those things. But from thy more exalted mind,
Celestina, I expected a more unprejudiced decision.
</p>
<p>
The person whose true name I conceal under this appellation, of all the
women that I was ever acquainted with, had the most manly turn of mind,
which she had improved by reading and the best conversation. Her
understanding was not more masculine, than her manners and whole
disposition were delicately and truly feminine. She was the daughter of an
officer who had fallen in the service of his country, leaving his widow
and Celestina, an only child, with a fortune sufficient to set them above
want, but not to enable them to live in splendour. I had the mother&rsquo;s
permission to pay my addresses to the young lady, and Celestina seemed to
approve of my suit.
</p>
<p>
Often and often have I poured out my overcharged soul in the presence of
Celestina, complaining of the hard and unfeeling prejudices of the world;
and the sweet maid has again and again declared, that no irrational
prejudice should hinder her from esteeming every man according to his
intrinsic worth. Often has she repeated the consolatory assurance, that
she could never consider as essentially ignominious an <i>accident</i>,
which was indeed to be deprecated, but which might have happened to the
most innocent of mankind.&mdash;Then would she set forth some illustrious
example, which her reading easily furnished, of a Phocion or a Socrates
unjustly condemned; of a Raleigh or a Sir Thomas More, to whom late
posterity had done justice; and by soothing my fancy with some such
agreeable parallel, she would make me almost to triumph in my disgrace,
and convert my shame into glory.
</p>
<p>
In such entertaining and instructive conversations the time passed on,
till I importunately urged the mistress of my affections to name a day for
our union. To this she obligingly consented, and I thought myself the
happiest of mankind. But how was I surprised one morning on the receipt of
the following billet from my charmer:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;You must not impute it to levity, or to a worse
failing, ingratitude, if, with anguish of heart, I feel
myself compelled by irresistible arguments to recal a vow
which I fear I made with too little consideration. I never
can be yours. The reasons of my decision, which is final,
are in my own breast, and you must everlastingly remain a
stranger to them. Assure yourself that I can never cease to
esteem you as I ought.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Celestina&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
At the sight of this paper, I ran in frantic haste to Celestina&rsquo;s
lodgings, where I learned, to my infinite mortification, that the mother
and daughter were set off on a journey to a distant part of the country,
to visit a relation, and were not expected to return in less than four
months.
</p>
<p>
Stunned by this blow, which left me without the courage to solicit an
explanation by letter, even if I had known where they were (for the
particular address was industriously concealed from me), I waited with
impatience the termination of the period, in the vain hope that I might be
permitted to have a chance of softening the harsh decision, by a personal
interview with Celestina after her return. But before three months were at
an end, I learned from the newspapers, that my beloved had&mdash;given her
hand to another!
</p>
<p>
Heart-broken as I was, I was totally at a loss to account for the strange
step which she had taken; and it was not till some years after, that I
learned the true reason from a female relation of hers, to whom it seems
Celestina had confessed in confidence, that it was no demerit of mine that
had caused her to break off the match so abruptly, nor any preference
which she might feel for any other person, for she preferred me (she was
pleased to say) to all mankind; but when she came to lay the matter closer
to her heart, she found that she never should be able to bear the sight&mdash;(I
give you her very words as they were detailed to me by her relation)&mdash;the
sight of a man in a nightcap, who had appeared on a public platform; it
would lead to such a disagreeable association of ideas! And to this
punctilio I was sacrificed.
</p>
<p>
To pass over an infinite series of minor mortifications, to which this
last and heaviest might well render me callous, behold me here, Mr.
Editor! in the thirty-seventh year of my existence (the twelfth, reckoning
from my re-animation), cut off from all respectable connexions, rejected
by the fairer half of the community,&mdash;who in my case alone seem to
have laid aside the characteristic pity of their sex; punished because I
was once punished unjustly; suffering for no other reason than because I
once had the misfortune to suffer without any cause at all. In no other
country, I think, but this, could a man have been subject to such a
life-long persecution, when once his innocence had been clearly
established.
</p>
<p>
Had I crawled forth a rescued victim from the rack in the horrible
dungeons of the Inquisition,&mdash;had I heaved myself up from a half
bastinado in China, or been torn from the just-entering, ghastly impaling
stake in Barbary,&mdash;had I dropt alive from the knout in Russia, or
come off with a gashed neck from the half-mortal, scarce-in-time-retracted
scymetar of an executioneering slave in Turkey,&mdash;I might have borne
about the remnant of this frame (the mangled trophy of reprieved
innocence) with credit to myself, in any of those barbarous countries. No
scorn, at least, would have mingled with the pity (small as it might be)
with which what was left of me would have been surveyed.
</p>
<p>
The singularity of my case has often led me to enquire into the reasons of
the general levity with which the subject of hanging is treated as a topic
in this country. I say as a topic; for let the very persons who speak so
lightly of the thing at a distance, be brought to view the real scene,&mdash;let
the platform be <i>bona fide</i> exhibited, and the trembling culprit
brought forth,&mdash;the case is changed; but as a topic of conversation,
I appeal to the vulgar jokes which pass current in every street. But why
mention them, when the politest authors have agreed in making use of this
subject as a source of the ridiculous? Swift, and Pope, and Prior, are
fond of recurring to it. Gay has built an entire drama upon this single
foundation. The whole interest of the <i>Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</i> may be said to
hang upon it. To such writers as Fielding and Smollett it is a perfect <i>bon
bouche</i>.&mdash;Hear the facetious Tom Brown, in his <i>Comical View of
London and Westminster</i>, describe the <i>Order of the Show at one of
the Tyburn executions</i> in his time:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Ordinary visits his
melancholy flock in Newgate, by eight. Doleful procession up Holborn-hill,
about eleven. Men handsome and proper that were never thought so before,
which is some comfort, however. Arrive at the fatal place by twelve. Burnt
brandy, women, and Sabbath-breaking, repented of. Some few penitential
drops fall under the gallows. Sheriffs&rsquo; men, parson, pickpockets,
criminals, all very busy. The last concluding peremptory psalm struck up.
Show over by one.&rdquo;&mdash;In this sportive strain does this misguided wit
think proper to play with a subject so serious, which yet he would hardly
have done, if he had not known that there existed a predisposition in the
habits of his unaccountable countrymen to consider the subject as a jest.
But what shall we say to Shakspeare, who (not to mention the solution
which the <i>Grave-digger</i> in <i>Hamlet</i> gives of his fellow
workman&rsquo;s problem), in that scene in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, where the
<i>Clown</i> calls upon <i>Master Barnardine</i> to get up and be hanged,
which he declines on the score of being sleepy, has actually gone out of
his way to gratify this amiable propensity in his countrymen; for it is
plain, from the use that was to be made of his head, and from <i>Abhorson&rsquo;s</i>
asking, &ldquo;is the axe upon the block, Sirrah?&rdquo; that beheading, and not
hanging, was the punishment to which <i>Barnardine</i> was destined. But
Shakspeare knew that the axe and block were pregnant with no ludicrous
images, and, therefore, falsified the historic truth of his own drama (if
I may so speak) rather than he would leave out such excellent matter for a
jest as the suspending of a fellow-creature in mid air has been ever
esteemed to be by Englishmen.
</p>
<p>
One reason why the ludicrous never fails to intrude itself into our
contemplations upon this mode of death, I suppose to be, the absurd
posture into which a man is thrown who is condemned to dance, as the
vulgar delight to express it, upon nothing. To see him whisking and
wavering in the air, to behold the vacant carcase, from which the life is
newly dislodged, shifting between earth and heaven, the sport of every
gust; like a weathercock, serving to show from which point the wind blows;
like a maukin, fit only to scare away birds; like a nest left to swing
upon a bough when the bird is flown; these are uses to which we cannot,
without a mixture of spleen and contempt, behold the human carcase
reduced. We string up dogs, foxes, bats, moles, weasels. Man surely
deserves a steadier death.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
As the wind you know will wave a man; *

* Hieronimo in the Spanish tragedy.
</pre>
<p>
Another reason why the ludicrous associates more forcibly with this than
with any other mode of punishment, I cannot help thinking to be, the
senseless costume with which an old prescription has thought fit to clothe
the exit of malefactors in this country. Let a man do what he will to
abstract from his imagination all idea of the whimsical, something of it
will come across him when he contemplates the figure of a fellow-creature
in the day-time (in however distressing a situation) in a night-cap.
Whether it be that this nocturnal addition has something discordant with
day-light, or that it is the dress which we are seen in at those times
when we are &ldquo;seen,&rdquo; as the Angel in Milton expresses it, &ldquo;least wise;&rdquo;
 this I am afraid will always be the case; unless, indeed, as in my
instance, some strong personal feeling overpower the ludicrous altogether.
To me, when I reflect upon the train of misfortunes which have pursued me
through life, owing to that accursed drapery, the cap presents as purely
frightful an object as the sleeveless yellow coat and devil-painted mitre
of the San Benitos. An ancestor of mine, who suffered for his loyalty in
the time of the civil wars, was so sensible of the truth of what I am here
advancing, that, on the morning of execution, no entreaties could prevail
upon him to submit to the odious dishabile, as he called it, but he
insisted upon wearing, and actually suffered in, the identical flowing
periwig which he is painted in, in the gallery belonging to my uncle&rsquo;s
seat.
</p>
<p>
Suffer me, Mr. Editor, before I quit the subject, to say a word or two
respecting the minister of justice in this country; in plain words, I mean
the hangman. It has always appeared tome, that, in the mode of inflicting
capital punishments with us, there is too much of the ministry of the
human hand. The guillotine, as performing its functions more of itself,
and sparing human agency, though a cruel and disgusting exhibition, in my
mind, has in many ways the advantage over <i>our way</i>. In beheading,
indeed, as it was formerly practised in England, and in whipping to death,
as is sometimes practised now, the hand of man is no doubt sufficiently
busy; but there is something less repugnant in these downright blows, than
in the officious barber-like ministrings of the other. To have a fellow
with his hangman&rsquo;s hands fumbling about your collar, adjusting the thing
as your valet would regulate your cravat, valuing himself on his menial
dexterity&mdash;I never shall forget meeting my rascal&mdash;I mean the
fellow who officiated for me,&mdash;in London last winter. I think I see
him now,&mdash;in a waistcoat that had been mine,&mdash;smirking along as
if he knew me.

<p>
In some parts of Germany that fellow&rsquo;s office is by law declared infamous,
and his posterity incapable of being ennobled. They have hereditary
hangmen, or had at least, in the same manner as they had other hereditary
great officers of state, and the hangman&rsquo;s families of two adjoining
parishes intermarried with each other, to keep the breed entire. I wish
something of the same kind were established in England.
</p>
<p>
But it is time to quit a subject which teems with disagreeable images,
lest we should suffer by <i>contamination.</i>

THE NEW &ldquo;BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>arshal Mont-Jean was as respectable a soldier as good king Francis had in
his army. It was currently reported in his troop that he had once been
young, although his hair was now grey, and that he had once been alert,
although the wounds from sword, lance, and bullet, which cicatrised his
body all over, had rendered him fit only for garrison duty. He was
entrusted with an important fortress on the frontiers of Piedmont, for his
royal master knew that his stiff and shrivelled body would as little think
of budging from before an enemy as the stone and lime he was set to guard.
</p>
<p>
Marshal Mont-Jean had a young wife&mdash;a lineal descendant of the noble
family of Chateaubriant&mdash;a girl in her seventeenth year, of a clear
car-nated complexion, through which the eloquent blood shone forth at
every word she spoke, with dark eyes at once penetrating and winning, and
with an elastic, buoyant, coquettish sort of a gait. Owing to family
politics, she had been married to the marshal before she very well knew
what marriage was. Naturally of an affectionate disposition, she loved the
tough old soldier&mdash;who, imperative and stern to all others, was
gentle to her&mdash;as a daughter might have done. Her little thoughts ran
more upon her gowns, headtires, and feathers, than any thing else. She
would have had no objections, had it lain in her power, to have displayed
these objects of her affections before the eyes of young French gallants,
but unluckily there were none such within reach. The soldiers of the
garrison were old and grizzled as their commander, or the walls they
tenanted. The Marquis of Saluzzo visited the marshal sometimes, to be
sure; but although not exactly old, he was ugly. His features were
irregular, his eyes dull and bleared, his complexion a yellowish black: he
had a big belly and a round back, and was heavy and lumpish in all his
motions. So the pretty lady had no one to please by her dresses but
herself, her handmaidens, and her venerable husband. And yet she was daily
dressed like the first princess of the land. It had been a fair sight to
see the delicate ape attired like unto some stately queen, and striving to
give to her petite figure, mincing steps, and laughing looks, an air of
solemn and stately reserve.
</p>
<p>
Every thing has an end, at least the life of Marshal Mont-Jean had. His
little widow was sincerely sorry, but her grief was not exactly
heartbreaking. She had respected him, but love was out of the question;
and with all her esteem for the man, and resignation to her fate, there
was something unnatural in the union of persons so widely differing in
age. But had she been ever so inclined to lament him, she would not have
had time. She was under the necessity of transporting herself immediately,
with all her own and her late husband&rsquo;s retainers, to her estates in
France, and she had not a single sol left in her possession. Her estates
were large, but even had there been time to await the arrival of money
from them, the times were too unsafe to hazard its transmission. The
country around her was too mountainous, and its air too pure and keen to
nourish usurers. Her dresses were of immense value, but there was no one
near who cared for such frippery, or could or would advance money upon its
pledge. The little lady was at her wit&rsquo;s end.
</p>
<p>
She felt no great alleviation of her troubles, when one day&mdash;after
wondering for a quarter of an hour what was the meaning of the tan tara of
trumpets before the gate, and the clattering of horses&rsquo; hoofs in the
court-yard&mdash;the Marquis of Saluzzo was ushered into her presence. He
was gaily apparelled in a tunic and hose of white silk, laced with silver,
and a hat of the same materials, with bushy white plumes waving over his
head. This costume communicated to his countenance&mdash;which rivalled in
colour the feet of a duck that has all day been wading in the mud&mdash;a
yet more repulsive expression. The young widow thought&mdash;when she saw
the portly belly come swagging into the hall before its owner, and the
worshipful marquis panting after it, with a multitude of ungainly bows&mdash;that
she had never seen any thing half so hideous.

<p>
Her visitor came at once to the point, for he was none of those who are
troubled with a fastidious delicacy. He had learned the situation of
embarrassment in which the marshal had left his lady, and came to inform
her that he was himself on the road to Paris, whither, if she would favour
him with her company, and join her train of attendants with his, he would
defray her expenses. He urged her acceptance of his proffered aid with
garrulous and indelicate importunity, fixing his gooseberry eyes upon her,
with an attempt to look languishing. Nay, in the pride of his heart, he
let her know that already many suitors were mustering to urge their claims
to the hand of the wealthy widow of Mont-Jean, the heiress apparent of the
noble house of Chateaubriant, and that he was not without hopes of
insinuating himself into her good graces during their journey. In our
days, it would be thought indelicate for a woman in the lady&rsquo;s situation
to accept an essential service from so blunt a knight; but in those days
the fair sex were not so particular. There was danger even then of being
inveigled; but Marie was young, lighthearted, undaunted, and fond of a
joke. She knew not enough of the world to be aware of the use an artful
man might take of such a journey, to render appearances against her,
should she finally repulse his advances. Lastly, there was no choice left
her, the new commandant was daily expected, and she could not raise a
maravedi.
</p>
<p>
The marquis and his fair companion were, by their style of travelling, and
the want of other company, kept close together during great part of the
journey. He was constantly by her bridle on the road, he was ready with
the proffer of his services whenever she dismounted, he sat by her at the
board&mdash;most frequently spread under the shadow of some branchy tree.
Marie gradually got reconciled to his appearance; and although she could
not respect a man, who in his incessant prattling gave tokens only of a
proud, foolish, and selfish mind, she learned to take pleasure in the
unconscious manner in which he displayed his character. His attempts to
express his love, too, were endless as ludicrous, and Marie was not the
person to shrink from a little coquetry, more particularly when the object
afforded her at the same time matter for a hearty laugh. She had a natural
talent for coquetting, and the restraint laid upon her of late by her
situation only heightened her desire to exercise it now.
</p>
<p>
Before the party reached Lyons, however, she was made painfully sensible
of her error. She remarked that the marquis took care to blazon
immediately to the whole train, every encouragement she gave him. In
private, he assumed a dictatorial tone, arranging who of her domestics it
were most advisable to retain or dismiss&mdash;assuming that their future
union was an event which must undoubtedly happen. His attendants affected
to look upon her with a peculiarly intelligent expression, and used every
artifice to draw from her speeches which might favour their master&rsquo;s
hopes. &ldquo;Ah, senora,&rdquo; said the steward, one day, as she was rallying him
about some trifle, &ldquo;these sharp words require a sweetener.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Depend upon it, good Jaques,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you shall have as heavy a
gold chain as the steward of the best marquis in the land, the day of my
marriage.&rdquo; She could have bit her tongue for vexation, when she saw the
old thief scuttle up to his master, and tell him the story, with a
profusion of &ldquo;nods and becks, and wreathed smiles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She learned, about the same time, from her female attendants, that they
had been prevented from forwarding any intelligence to their friends in
France; that her own messengers had been detained, and dispatches
addressed to her intercepted. She saw now that the wily Italian was
closing his meshes around her. She had looked upon him as a fool, a
creature out of whom she could extract amusement and advantage, and shake
him off&mdash;as lightly as the flower the refreshing dewdrop, when the
western breeze begins to blow. She found that the lowest order of minds
possess most practical cunning. She was fretted and anxious. His train
outnumbered hers, which consisted, moreover, chiefly of her female
attendants. She was, however, of too gay and confident a disposition to
remain long uneasy. They were now approaching Lyons, and in the city he
would not dare to detain her person by force. Her few men-at-arms were
hardy soldiers, and implicitly to be relied upon.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in the hostelrie, she made an excuse for retiring early. The
window of her apartment opened upon the Rhone. She sat, her head buried in
her hands, striving, but in vain, to determine upon some line of conduct.
The door opened, and her favourite tirewoman introduced a young gentleman,
richly but not gaudily equipped, of martial bearing. &ldquo;A messenger, my
lady, from your cousin, Vieilleville.&rdquo; The messenger bore a letter, in
which the Sieur de Vieilleville informed her that it was currently
reported in Paris she had promised her hand to the Marquis of Saluzzo, and
that the king, for political considerations, was intent upon the match;
that he, however, could not for a moment believe her so inconsiderate, and
that he was at hand with a body of sixty gens-d&rsquo;armes to free her.
</p>
<p>
The lady recognised at once the rude craft of Saluzzo in the reports to
which her cousin alluded. She trembled at the thought of the king
seconding the wishes of her unknightly suitor, but she rejoiced that the
full extent of her danger had only been laid open to her at the moment
that certain aid presented itself. Vieilleville was one of those
straightforward daring persons, who, having neither fear nor dishonesty in
their character, always pursue the direct road to their object. It was
well known that he had often opposed the king in his darling projects, yet
without losing his favour; for Francis knew that thoughts of self never
stained Vieilleville. The proudest nobles of France, the princes of the
blood, did not disdain to seek his countenance and protection, although he
was yet but a lieutenant of gendarmerie and a simple knight&mdash;not even
a member of the order.
</p>
<p>
With tumultuous joy, Marie addressed to her cousin a warm letter of thanks
for his confidence in the propriety of her conduct. Love for a man of
Saluzzo&rsquo;s character was out of the question. As for the king&rsquo;s deep-laid
schemes, she had been sacrificed when a child to political considerations,
but now, a woman and her own mistress, she would submit to such treatment
from no one. She threw herself unreservedly upon her cousin&rsquo;s protection.
As, however, the marquis and she were next day to cross the hills to
Rouanne, there to embark on the Loire, and sail down to Briare, whence
they were to proceed by land through Essonne to Paris, she ventured to
suggest what seemed the quietest mode of getting her out of the marquis&rsquo;s
hands. She proposed that Vieilleville should advance with his troop to
Corbeil, taking care to arrive the same evening that she reached Essonne.
Next day he was to direct his course towards Juvizy, and entering it at
the same time, her steward should so arrange matters that her attendants
could in a moment separate themselves from the cortège of the marquis, and
attach themselves to that of Vieilleville. With such a knight opposed to
him, and in the broad eye of day, Saluzzo would yield without resistance.
</p>
<p>
Marie, as she next day rode across the mountains, was wild with joy. The
fresh breezes of the uplands, and the rapturous thought of approaching
freedom, filled her with transport. She teased her steed to perform a
thousand gambols, she sung in emulation of the birds by the way-side, she
squandered a thousand malicious kind looks upon the lout by her side, she
had a good word and a gift for every menial in the train, Her delicate
figure, flashing eyes, and graceful wildness, kept all eyes fixed upon her
with love and wonder.
</p>
<p>
Next day the party embarked upon the Loire, but the first intoxication of
joy was over. The equable motion of the boat, the gentle rippling of the
waves, the heat of the day, the deep shades beneath which they
occasionally passed, relaxed her frame. A band of music which the marquis
had engaged at Lyons, aided, by its soft plaintive melodies, to give a
melancholy character to her reflections. She thought of her indiscretion,
of the toils from which she was not yet free, of the slanders and
calumnies to which she might be exposed. The careless innocence of a young
woman may lead her into conduct, to look upon which impresses her with a
tormenting consciousness of sullied purity, although not one criminal
thought has ruffled her white mind. It was thus with Marie. Lost in
self-reproach, she bowed her head over the gunwale of the boat, and played
in the water with her fingers, while a big tear gathered beneath each
jetty eyelash. Her ugly companion sat beside her, gazing upon the fair
mourner with a nauseous expression of affection and confidence. The change
of her mood since yesterday, was too palpable to escape even his gross
apprehension. But he attributed it with great complacency to the
waywardness of love, believing himself to be the object. His attachment to
Marie was a strange mixture of avarice, gratified vanity, and admiration
of her beauty.
</p>
<p>
Let us hasten to the close of our story. It was mid-day, and the crowds
which had thronged the market-place of Juvizy were dispersing, when a
knight, armed at all points, his vizor up, rode into the great square,
followed by eighty men-at-arms. He sat on his strong black horse like an
upright pillar of iron. His look was sedate, but frank and careless, as of
one whose blood flowed as calmly, and whose thoughts were as clear amid
the thunder of the fight as in the retirement of his own chamber. There
was a universal expression of love and reverence, for every peasant knew
Vieilleville. His troop drew up in a wide street which abutted on the
market-place, at one end of the town-house.
</p>
<p>
They had not waited many minutes when the sound of approaching horses was
heard, and soon after, a large company, in which were a number of females,
the men, though more numerous, neither so well equipped nor skilfully
arranged as those of Vieilleville, entered the square. A knight and a lady
rode foremost. The eye of the latter glanced bright as it fell upon
Vieilleville and his attendants. They advanced towards the town-house, the
greater proportion of their followers edging off towards a street at the
other end of the building from that occupied by Vieilleville. The women,
and a few soldiers, turned their horses towards the troop which had
arrived before them. Saluzzo (for it was he), espying this, called after
them that they had mistaken their way.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With your pardon, fair Sir,&rdquo; said Marie, checking her steed, &ldquo;they are
quite right. Your lodgings are at the hostelrie of the Bear; mine at that
of St. Denis. My cousin Vieilleville is here to relieve you of the charge
I have so unwillingly imposed upon you; and you know how indecorous it
would be to prefer the protection of a stranger to so near a relation. My
steward will reckon with yours at Paris for any expense you may have
incurred on my account. The debt of gratitude I owe you I never can hope
to pay.&rdquo; And here the innate devil of coquetry resumed its sway as her
spirits rose. &ldquo;I leave my heart in your keeping, fair Sir. Take good care
of it.&rdquo; Saluzzo was too well aware of his own powers to dream of coping
with Vieilleville. He saw his fairy visions melting away, and he wept for
spite and sorrow. With a cowed look he took her proffered hand, and
pressed it to his lips. In the very wantonness of malice, she gently
pressed his paw, smiled, and cast one of her most winning glances at him;
then, turning suddenly, as if to hide a blush, she cantered smiling
towards her cousin. The crest-fallen marquis retired in a super-eminently
savage mood to his den.
</p>
<p>
On reaching the hostelrie, Vieilleville presented to Marie a young knight,
whom she recognised as the bearer of his letter. &ldquo;The Prince of
Roche-sur-Yonne, fair cousin&mdash;the playmate of your childhood, the
admirer of your womanly beauties, and one who, as you well know, lately
undertook a service of some danger and difficulty for your sake.&rdquo; The
prince was certainly an amiable and handsome young man, his late service
gave him some claim to a kind reception, and in the course of a few hours&rsquo; 
conversation, so many childish hours of happiness had been re-awakened in
Marie&rsquo;s memory, that she felt as if her youthful playmate and she,
although separated, had never been disjoined&mdash;she persuaded herself
that some invisible bond had held them together, although herself had
remained unaware of it until circumstances drew the noose tighter. The
prince secured his footing by a thousand delicate and unpretending
attentions. On the eve of the third day, just before they entered Paris,
Vieilleville reminded his cousin of the danger she incurred from the
king&rsquo;s anxiety to see her married to Saluzzo, and urged a speedy private
marriage to the prince. Marie saw the propriety of the advice; her own
inclinations were not adverse; the good marshal dwelt in her memory rather
as a revered parent than as a beloved husband&mdash;in short, she
consented.
</p>
<p>
This arrangement was kept of course a profound secret from Saluzzo. On
recovering from his dumps, the malicious pressure of his hand, and the
rosy smile which accompanied it, broke like morning on his memory. It is
strange what a power of self-deception the mind possesses. When a lover
has long wished to gain his mistress&rsquo;s affections, picturing to himself
the possible awakening of love in her breast, and all the nes of his
future happiness, the images of his fancy grow so vivid, that he cannot
persuade himself they are unreal. The slightest indication is eagerly
caught at as a proof of their reality. A thousand proofs of dislike are
effaced from recollection by one kind look. This holds true even with such
questionable passions as that of Saluzzo. He paid a daily visit to Marie
Mont-Jean, still trusting that although one visit afforded no room for
hope, the next might. In vain: the Prince of Roche-sur-Yonne was always
there before him, managed to remain longer, and engrossed all the
conversation and kind looks of the lady.
</p>
<p>
At last Saluzzo resolved to change his tactics. He summoned the lady
before the parliament, to be adjudged to implement a promise of marriage,
which he alleged she had made to him during their journey. Vieilleville,
the prince, and Marie, held a council of war, and it was agreed that their
measures should be directed by the first mentioned.
</p>
<p>
The president and counsellors were assembled in full chamber, after
receiving a brief but pithy hint from the king, to take care how they
crossed his wishes. The clerk of the court was mending his pen with the
most assiduous gravity. Saluzzo approached the bar, attended by a lean,
sallow notary, and some creatures of the court. At the same moment, Marie
de Montespedon, relict of the late Marshal Mont-Jean, entered the hall,
leaning on the arm of the redoubted Monsieur de Vieilleville, attended by
a gallant train of ladies, lords, and gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
The preliminary forms having been observed the president directed the lady
to take the oath of verity with bared and uplifted hands. The first
interrogatory put to her was. &ldquo;Did you ever promise marriage to the noble
gentleman, the Marquis of Saluzzo, now in presence?&rdquo; The blood rushed into
the cheeks of the lady; she turned her eyes resolutely upon the marquis,
who looked upon the ground, his colour growing blacker and yet more
bloodless. She replied in a low whisper, which was heard through the whole
hall, &ldquo;No, by the virtue of mine oath.&rdquo; The president opened his mouth as
if to put another question, and the clerk sharpened his ears, and brought
his pen in contact with the paper, but the lady interrupted them, her face
glowing crimson, in hurried but distinct words: &ldquo;Gentlemen! I am not
accustomed to such exhibitions. I fear my woman&rsquo;s wit may be entangled
amid your forms and subtleties. I will cut this matter short. Before this
noble company I declare as I shall answer to King Francis with my broad
lands, and to God with my soul, as I live and regard my honour, I never
gave troth, nor faith, nor promise of marriage, to that lying caitiff, nor
ever dreamed of such a folly. And if any one call in question this my
declaration, here&rdquo;&mdash;she continued, taking Vieilleville by the hand&mdash;&ldquo;here
stands my champion, whom I present to maintain my words, which he knows to
be true, and from the mouth of a lady of honour, if ever one existed. I
place my trust, under God and my good cause, in his valour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That alters the case,&rdquo; said the president, smiling with secret
satisfaction at being freed from the necessity of displeasing the king.
&ldquo;Clerk, you may remove your books&mdash;there is no more need of writing.
The lady has preferred a form of process much more summary than ours. And
you, Sir Marquis! What is your pleasure?&rdquo; Saluzzo had too sincere a
respect for his ungainly body to hazard it against Vieilleville. &ldquo;I will
marry no woman by constraint,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;If she do not affect me, I
can do without her.&rdquo; As Vieilleville passed through the antechamber, one
of the judges accosted him in a low voice. &ldquo;You have saved yourself a six
months&rsquo; work, worse than the <i>corvée</i>, by this wager of battle. The
marquis had a list of forty interrogations for the lady, in which every
word she ever spoke to himself or servants, every pressure of his hand,
was enumerated.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;it is only a French woman who has outwitted a hundred
Italians.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; pursued his informant, &ldquo;it is your valour which has extricated her
from an ugly scrape. Away, and celebrate the wedding; for I much
misinterpret the looks of the prince and lady if that be not what you are
driving at.&rdquo;

<h2>
TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. FORTY YEARS AGO.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a lovely morning; a remittance had arrived in the very nick of
time; my two horses were in excellent condition; and I resolved, with a
college chum, to put in execution a long concerted scheme of driving to
London, Tandem. We sent our horses forward, got others at Cambridge, and
tossing Algebra and Anarcharsis &ldquo;to the dogs&rdquo; started in high spirits. We
ran up to London in style&mdash;went ball-pitch to the play&mdash;and
after a quiet breakfast at the St. James&rsquo;s, set out with my own horses
upon a dashing drive through the west end of the town. We were turning
down the Haymarket, when whom, to my utter horror and consternation,
should I see crossing to meet us, but my old warmhearted, but severe and
peppery uncle, Sir Thomas.

<p>
To escape was impossible.&mdash;A cart before, and two carriages behind,
made us stationary; and I mentally resigned all idea of ever succeeding to
his five thousand per annum. Up he came. &ldquo;What! can I believe my eyes?
George? what the-do you here? Tandem too, by&mdash;&mdash; (I leave blanks
for the significant accompaniments which dropped from his mouth like
pearls, and rubies in the fairy tale, when he was in a passion.) I have
it, thought I, as an idea crossed my mind which I resolved to follow. I
looked right and left, as if it was not possible it could be me he was
addressing.&mdash;&ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t know me, you young dog? Don&rsquo;t you know
your uncle? Why, Sir, in the name of common sense&mdash;Pshaw! you&rsquo;ve done
with that. Why in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; name a&rsquo;nt you at Cambridge?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At Cambridge, Sir?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;At Cambridge, Sir,&rdquo; he repeated, mimicking
my affected astonishment; &ldquo;why I suppose you never were at Cambridge!&mdash;Oh!
you young spendthrift; is this the manner you dispose of my allowance? Is
this the way you read hard? you young profligate, you young &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
you &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; Seeing he was getting energetic, I began to be
apprehensive of a <i>scene</i>; and resolved to drop the curtain at once,
&ldquo;Really, Sir,&rdquo; said I, with as brazen a look as I could summon upon
emergency, &ldquo;I have not the honour of your acquaintance.&rdquo; His large eyes
assumed a fixed stare of astonishment. &ldquo;I must confess you have the
advantage of me. Excuse me; but, to my knowledge, I never saw you before.&rdquo;&mdash;A
torrent, I perceived, was coming.&mdash;&ldquo;Make no apologies, they are
unnecessary. Your next <i>rencontre</i> will, I hope, be more fortunate,
though your finding your country cousin in London is like looking for a
needle in a bundle of hay.&mdash;Bye, bye, old buck.&rdquo; The cart was
removed, and I drove off, yet not without seeing him, in a paroxysm of
rage, half frightful, half ludicrous, toss his hat on the ground, and
hearing him exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;He disowns me! the jackanapes! disowns his own
uncle by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poor Philip Chichester&rsquo;s look of amazement at this finished stroke of
impudence is present, at this instant, to my memory. I think I see his
face, which at no time had more expression than a turnip, assume that air
of a pensive simpleton, <i>d&rsquo;un mouton qui rêve</i>, which he so often and
so successfully exhibited over an incomprehensible problem in &ldquo;Principia.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well! you&rsquo;ve done it.&mdash;Dished completely. What could induce you to
be such a blockhead?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The family of the blockheads, my dear
Phil,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is far too creditably established in society to render
their alliance disgraceful. I&rsquo;m proud to belong to so prevailing a party.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pshaw! this is no time for joking. What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, when does a man want a joke, Phil, but when he is in trouble?
However, adieu to <i>badinage</i>, and hey for Cambridge, instantly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cambridge?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the twinkling of an eye&mdash;not a moment to be lost. My uncle will
post there with four horses instantly; and my only chance of avoiding that
romantic misfortune of being cut off with a shilling, is to be there
before him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Without settling the bill at the inn, or making a single arrangement, we
dashed back to Cambridge. Never shall I forget the mental anxiety I
endured on my way there. Every thing was against us. A heavy rain had
fallen in the night, and the roads were wretched, the traces broke&mdash;turnpike
gates were shut&mdash;droves of sheep and carts impeded our progress; but
in spite of all these obstacles, we reached the college in less than six
hours. &ldquo;Has Sir Thomas &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; been here?&rdquo; said I to
the porter, with an agitation I could not conceal. &ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo; Phil
&ldquo;thanked God, and took courage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he does, tell him so and so,&rdquo; said I, giving <i>veracious</i> Thomas
his instructions, and putting a guinea into his hand to sharpen his
memory. &ldquo;Phil, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t shew your face out of college for
this fortnight. You twig! God bless you.&rdquo;&mdash;I had barely time to get
to my own room, to have my toga and trencher beside me, Newton and
Aristotle before me&mdash;optics, mechanics, and hydrostatics, strewed
around in learned confusion, when my uncle drove up to the gate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Porter, I wish to see Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;is he in his
rooms?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Sir; I saw him take a heap of books there ten minutes ago.&rdquo; This was
not the first bouncer the Essence of Truth, as Thomas was known through
college, had told for me; nor the last he got well paid for. &ldquo;Ay! Very
likely; reads very hard, I dare say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt of that, I believe, Sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, as bold as brass. &ldquo;You
audacious fellow! how dare you look in my face and tell me such a
deliberate falsehood? You know he&rsquo;s not in college!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in college! Sir; as I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None of your hopes or fears to me. Shew me his rooms.&mdash;If two hours
ago I did not see &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. See him,&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ve seen
him, and he&rsquo;s seen the last of me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had now reached my rooms; and never shall I forget his look of
astonishment, of amazement bordering on incredulity, when I calmly came
forward, took his hand, and welcomed him to Cambridge. &ldquo;My dear Sir, how
are you? What lucky wind has blown you here?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What George! who&mdash;what&mdash;why&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t believe my eyes!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How happy I am to see you!&rdquo; I continued;
&ldquo;How kind of you to come! How well you&rsquo;re looking!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How people may
be deceived! My dear George (speaking rapidly), I met a fellow, in a
tandem, in the Haymarket, so like you in every particular, that I hailed
him at once. The puppy disowned me&mdash;affected to cut a joke&mdash;and
drove off. Never was I more taken off my stilts. I came down directly,
with four post-horses, to tell your tutor; to tell the master; to tell all
the college, that I would have nothing more to do with you; that I would
be responsible for your debts no longer; to inclose you fifty pounds and
disown you for ever&rdquo;&mdash;My dear Sir, how singular!&rdquo;&mdash;Singular! I
wonder at perjury no longer, for my part. I would have gone into any court
of justice, and would have taken my oath it was you. I never saw such a
likeness. Your father and the fellow&rsquo;s mother were acquainted, or I&rsquo;m
mistaken. The air, the height, the voice, all but the manner, and&mdash;that
was <i>not</i> yours. No, no, you never would have treated your uncle so.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How
rejoiced I am, that&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Rejoiced; so am I. I would not but have been undeceived for a thousand
guineas. Nothing but seeing you here so quiet, so studious, surrounded by
problems, would have convinced me. Ecod! I can&rsquo;t tell you how I was
startled. I had been told some queer stories, to be sure, about your
Cambridge etiquette. I heard that two Cambridge men, one of St. John&rsquo;s,
the other of Trinity, had met on the top of Vesuvius, and that though they
knew each other by sight and reputation, yet, never having been formally
introduced, like two simpletons, they looked at each other in silence, and
left the mountain separately and without speaking: and that cracked
fellow-commoner, Meadows, had shewn me a caricature, taken from the life,
representing a Cambridge man drowning, and another gownsman standing on
the brink, exclaiming, &lsquo;Oh! that I had had the honour of being introduced
to that man, that I might have taken the liberty of saving him!&rsquo; But,&mdash;it,
thought I, he never would carry it so far with his own uncle!&mdash;I
never heard your father was a gay man,&rdquo; continued he, musing; &ldquo;yet, as you
sit in that light, the likeness is&mdash;&rdquo; I moved instantly&mdash;&ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s impossible, you know, it&rsquo;s impossible. Come, my dear fellow, come; I
must get some dinner. Who could he be? Never were two people so like!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We dined at the inn, and spent the evening together; and instead of the
fifty, the &ldquo;<i>last fifty</i>,&rdquo; he generously gave me a draft lor three
times the amount. He left Cambridge the next morning and his last words
were, as he entered his carriage, &ldquo;My brother <i>was</i> a handsome man;
and there <i>was</i> a Lady Somebody, who, the world said was partial to
him. She <i>may</i> have a son. Most surprising likeness. God bless you.
Read hard, you young dog; remember. Like as two Brothers!&rdquo;&mdash;I never
saw him again.
</p>
<p>
His death, which happened a few months afterwards, in consequence ol his
being <i>bit</i> in a bet, contracted when he was a &ldquo;little elevated,&rdquo;
 left me the heir to his fine estate; I wish I could add, to his many and
noble virtues. I do not attempt to palliate deception. It is always
criminal. But, I am sure, no severity, no reprimand, no reproaches, would
have had half the effect which his kindness, his confidence, and his
generosity wrought on me. It reformed me thoroughly, and at once. I did
not see London again till I had graduated: and if my degree was
unaccompanied by brilliant honours, it did not disgrace my uncle&rsquo;s
liberality or his name. Many years have elapsed since our last interview;
but I never reflect on it without pain and pleasure&mdash;pain, that our
last intercourse on earth should have been marked by the grossest
deception; and pleasure, that the serious reflections it awakened, cured
me for ever of all wish to deceive, and made the open and straightforward
path of life.

It is the very key-stone to polite society; it is the <i>open sesame</i>
to the highest honours both in church and state. Look at any individual
making his <i>entrée</i> into a drawing-room, where there is a circle in
the slightest degree distinguished for taste and elegance. Is it his coat,
his waistcoat, his shirt, his inexpressibles, his silk stocking, or his
shoe, to which the glass of the critic, or the soft eye of beauty, is
principally directed? No! it is none of these. It is the cravat that
instantaneously stamps the character of its wearer. If it be put on with a
<i>recherché</i> air&mdash;if its folds be correct, and its set <i>comme
il faut</i>&mdash;then he may defy fate. Even though his coat should not
be of the last <i>cut</i>, and his waistcoat buttoned a whole button too
high, still he will carry everything before him. The man of fashion will
own him for an equal&mdash;beauty will smile upon him as a friend&mdash;and
humbler aspirants will gaze with fond and respectful admiration on the
individual who has so successfully studied the art of tying the cravat.
But behold the reverse of the picture! Suppose that the unhappy wretch is
but an ignorant pretender to a knowledge of the proper mode of covering
that part of the person which separates the shoulders from the chin&mdash;a
being who disgraces his laundress by the most barbarous use of her
well-ironed and folded neckcloths, starched with that degree of nicety,
that a single grain more or less would have made the elasticity too great
or the suppleness too little;&mdash;suppose this Yahoo, with a white
cravat tied round his neck like a rope, somewhat after the fashion most in
vogue among the poorer class of divinity students, were to enter a
drawingroom! What man on earth would not turn away from him in disgust?
The very poodle would snap at his heels, and the large tortoise-shell cat
upon the hearth-rug would elevate her back into the form of an arch,
bristle up her tail like a brush, and spit at him with sentiments of
manifest indignation. Ladies would shrink from the contamination of his
approach, and the dearest friend he had in the world would cut him dead
upon the spot. He might, perhaps, be a man of genius; but what is the
value of genius to a person ignorant of the &ldquo;Art of Tying the Cravat?&rdquo; Let
us inquire for a moment into the history of the cravat, and the influence
it has always held over society in general. &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;art de mettre sa cravate</i>,&rdquo;
 says a French philosopher (Montesquieu, we think), &ldquo;<i>est à l&rsquo;homme du
monde ce que l&rsquo;art de donner à diner est à l&rsquo;homme d&rsquo;etat</i>.&rdquo; It is
believed that the Germans have the merit of inventing the cravat, which
was first used in the year 1636, by a regiment of Croats then in their
service. Croat, being pronounced Cro-at, was easily corrupted into cravat.
The Greeks and Romans usually wore their neck free and uncovered, although
in winter they sometimes wrapped a comforter round their throats, which
they called a <i>focalium</i>, from <i>fauces</i>. Augustus Cæsar, who was
particularly liable to catch cold, continually used a <i>focalium</i> or
<i>sudarium</i>. Even now, it is only some of the European nations who use
cravats. Throughout all the east the throat is invariably kept uncovered,
and a white and well-turned neck is looked upon as a great beauty, being,
metaphorically compared to a tower of ivory. In France, for a long period,
the ruff, stiffened and curled in single or double rows, was the favourite
ornament of the neck; but when Louis XIII. introduced the fashion of
wearing the hair in long ringlets upon the shoulders, the ruff was
necessarily abandoned. In 1660, when a regiment of Croats arrived in
France, their singular <i>tour de cou</i> attracted particular attention.
It was made of muslin or silk, and the ends, arranged <i>en rosette</i>,
hung gracefully on the breast. The cro-at (now cravat) became the passion;
and the throat, which had hitherto been comparatively free, lost its
liberty for ever. Many varieties were introduced; but a fine starched
linen cloth acquired the ascendency over all other, and retains it to this
day. Abuses crept in, however, for the fancy of the <i>èlégans</i> ran
wanton on the subject of pieces of muslin, stiffeners, collars, and
stocks. At one time it was fashionable to wear such a quantity of
bandaging round the neck, that shot has been known to lodge in it with
perfect impunity to the wearer, and few sabre cuts could find their way
through. Stocks are a variety of the cravat species, which are now very
general. Collars were the <i>avant-couriers</i> of stocks, and were
sometimes worn by the Egyptians and Greeks, made of the richest metals,
and ornamented with precious stones. Of late years, a black silk cravat
has come into great favour, and with a white or light-coloured waistcoat
especially, it has a manly and agreeable effect. Bonaparte commonly wore a
black silk cravat, and in it he fought at Lodi, Marengo, and Austerlitz.
It is somewhat remarkable, however, that at Waterloo he wore a white
neckcloth, although the day previous he appeared in his black cravat. Some
persons have attempted to introduce coloured silk cravats, but, much to
the honour of this country, the attempt has failed. A cravat of red silk
in particular, can be worn only by a Manchester tailor.
</p>
<p>
Such is a very brief abstract of the rise and progress of cravats; if they
are ever destined to lose the place they at present hold in society, we
fervently trust that some Gibbon may appear, to furnish us with a
narrative of their decline and fall. But though all this knowledge is
valuable, it is only preliminary to the great art of tying the cravat. <i>Hic
labor, hoc opus</i>. The first tie&mdash;the parent of all the others, the
most important, and by far the most deeply interesting&mdash;is the <i>noeud
Gordien</i>, or Gordian knot. Alexander the Great would have given half
his empire to have understood it;&mdash;Brummell was a prouder, a happier,
and a greater man, when he first accomplished it. The mode of forming this
<i>noeud Gordien</i> is the most important problem that can be offered to
the student of the cravat. It is no easy task; and we seriously advise
those, who are not initiated into the mysteries of this delightful
science, to make their first essays on a moderate-sized block.
</p>
<p>
We can confidently assure them, that, with tolerable perseverance, they
will be enabled to pursue their studies with pleasure and advantage, and
in a more profitable manner&mdash;on themselves. All the practice that is
necessary, need not occupy more time than a couple of hours a day!
</p>
<p>
After the <i>noeud Gordien</i> come a host of others, all of which ought
to be known for the sake of variety, and that the tie may be made to suit
the occasion on which it is worn. There is the <i>cravate à l&rsquo;Orientale</i>,
when the neckcloth is worn in the shape of a turban, and the ends form a
crescent;&mdash;the <i>cravate à l&rsquo;Américaine</i>, which is simple, but
not much to our taste, and the prevailing colours are detestable, being
sea-green, striped blue, or red and white;&mdash;the <i>cravate collier de
cheval</i>, in which, after making the <i>noeud Gordien</i>, the ends are
carried round and fastened behind; a style much admired by ladies&rsquo; maids
and milliners, but in our opinion essentially vulgar, unless when used out
of doors;&mdash;the <i>cravate sentimentale</i>, in which a <i>rosette</i>
is fastened at the top immediately under the chin, and which ought to be
worn only by dapper apprentices, who write &ldquo;sweet things&rdquo; on the Sundays,
or by Robert Montgomery, the author of &ldquo;The Omnipresence of the Deity&rdquo;&mdash;a
young man much puffed by Mr. William Jerdan;&mdash;the <i>cravate à la
Byron</i>, very free and <i>dégagée</i>, but submitted to by the noble
poet, only when accommodating himself to the <i>bien séances</i> of
society;&mdash;the <i>cravate en cascade</i>, where the linen is brought
down over the breast something like a <i>jet d&rsquo;eau</i>, and is a style in
great vogue among valets and butlers;&mdash;the <i>cravate à la Bergami</i>,
and the <i>cravate de bal</i>, where there is no knot at all, the ends
being brought forward, crossed on the breast, and then fastened to the
braces;&mdash;the <i>cravate mathématique</i>, grave and severe, where the
ends descend obliquely, and form two acute angles in crossing;&mdash;the
<i>cravatte à l&rsquo;Irelandoise</i>, upon the same principle as the preceding,
but somewhat more airy;&mdash;the <i>cravate à la gastronome</i>, which is
a narrow neckcloth, without starch, fastened very slightly, so that in
cases of incipient suffocation it may be removed at a moment&rsquo;s notice;&mdash;the
<i>cravate de chasse</i>, or <i>à la Diane</i>, which is worn only on the
hunting field, and ought to be deep green the <i>cravate en coquille</i>,
the tie of which resembles a shell, and is very pleasing, though a little
finical; the <i>cravate romantique, à la fidélité, à la Talma, à
l&rsquo;Italienne, à la Russe</i>, together with the <i>cravate Jesuitique et
diplomatique</i>, are interesting, and may all be studied to advantage.
</p>
<p>
In concluding these observations, which are meant to rouse, if possible,
the attention of a slumbering public to a subject, the vast importance of
which the common herd of mankind are too apt to overlook, we cannot help
reflecting with feelings of the most painful kind on the very small number
of persons who are able to tie their cravats in any thing like a
Brummellian or Pe-tershamic style. We call upon our readers, if they value
their necks, to show a greater regard for their cravats. They may rest
assured that a well-tied cravat is better than the most flattering letter
of introduction, or most prepossessing expression of countenance. An
elegant <i>noeud Gordien</i> has been known to secure for its possessor
5,000 L. a-year, and a handsome woman into the bargain. Let it not be
viewed as a light or trifling matter; a cravat, <i>comme il faut</i>, is
synonymous with happiness, and they who know the difference between neck
and nothing, will at once perceive that the &ldquo;march of intellect&rdquo; means
little more than a due appreciation of the value of the cravat, and as
near an approach as possible to perfection, in the art of tying it.

<h2>
THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the year 1704, a gentleman, to all appearance, of large fortune, took
furnished lodgings in a house in Soho Square. After he had resided there
some weeks with his establishment, he lost his brother, who had lived at
Hampstead, and who, on his death-bed, particularly desired to be interred
in the family-vault at Westminster Abbey. The gentleman requested his
landlord to permit him to bring the corpse of his brother to his lodgings,
and to make arrangements there for the funeral. The landlord, without
hesitation, signified his compliance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The body, dressed in a white shroud, was accordingly brought in a very
handsome coffin, and placed in the great dining-room. The funeral was to
take place the next day, and the lodger and his servants went out to make
the necessary preparations for the solemnity. He staid out late; but this
was no uncommon thing. The landlord and his family, conceiving that they
had no occasion to wait for him, retired to bed as usual about twelve
o&rsquo;clock. One maid-servant was left up to let him in, and to boil some
water, which he had desired might be ready for making tea on his return.
The girl was accordingly sitting all alone in the kitchen, when a tall,
spectre-looking figure entered, and clapped itself down in a chair
opposite to her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The maid was by no means one of the most timid of her sex; but she was
terrified beyond expression, lonely as she was, at this unexpected
apparition. Uttering a loud scream, she flew out like an arrow at a side
door, and hurried to the chamber of her master and mistress. Scarcely had
she awakened them, and communicated to the whole family some portion of
the fright with which she was herself overwhelmed, when the spectre,
enveloped in a shroud, and with a face of deathlike paleness, made its
appearance, and sat down in a chair in the bed-room, without their having
observed how it entered. The worst of all was, that this chair stood by
the door of the bedchamber, so that not a creature could get away without
passing close to the apparition, which rolled its glaring eyes so
frightfully, and so hideously distorted its features, that they could not
bear to look at it. The master and mistress crept under the bed-clothes,
covered with profuse perspiration, while the maid-servant sunk nearly
insensible by the side of the bed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the same time the whole house seemed to be in an uproar; for though
they had covered themselves over head and ears, they could still hear the
incessant noise and clatter, which served to increase their terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At length all became perfectly still in the house. The landlord ventured
to raise his head, and to steal a glance at the chair by the door; but,
behold, the ghost was gone! Sober reason began to resume its power. The
poor girl was brought to herself after a good deal of shaking. In a short
time, they plucked up sufficient courage to quit the bed-room, and to
commence an examination of the house, which they expected to find in great
disorder. Nor were their anticipations unfounded. The whole house had been
stripped by artful thieves, and the gentleman had decamped without paying
for his lodging. It turned out that he was no other than an accomplice of
the notorious Arthur Chambers, who was executed at Tyburn in 1706; and
that the supposed corpse was this arch rogue himself, who had whitened his
hands and face with chalk, and merely counterfeited death. About midnight
he quitted the coffin, and appeared to the maid in the kitchen. When she
flew up stairs, he softly followed her, and, seated, at the door of the
chamber, he acted as a sentinel, so that his industrious accomplices were
enabled to plunder the house without the least molestation.&rdquo;

<h2>
THE CLOAKS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following tale is taken from a work by M. Loeve Veimars, entitled &lsquo;Les
Manteaux.&rsquo; The scene is laid in Germany, and the story opens with the
election of a magistrate of the little city of Birling. Full of his new
dignity, he repairs to his home, where he acquaints his patient wife, to
whom he is in the habit of playing the tyrant, with the accession to his
importance. His old friend, Waldau, the town clerk, comes to ask him if he
has any commands for Felsenbourg, the seat of the administration, whither
he is about to repair. The new councillor requests him to deliver a letter
to his younger brother, Maurice, who had quitted his home suddenly, and of
whom he has heard nothing until very recently, and who has now applied to
him for a share of their father&rsquo;s property, or some pecuniary assistance.
The answer of the elder brother is at once unsatisfactory and unfeeling:
he tells him that their parent died without any fortune, and concludes
with a sneer at his youthful irregularities. The councillor&rsquo;s amiable
spouse is affected by her husband&rsquo;s cruelty; Waldau&rsquo;s dress is more
consistent with his scanty means than adapted to the inclemency of the
weather, and she expresses a hope that his travelling costume is a warmer
one.
</p>
<p>
‘Alas! no,&rsquo; replies Waldau; &lsquo;I had a cloak, but I have given it to my
grandmother, who is confined to her arm-chair with the gout, and I am in
truth, setting off like the prodigal son.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Dear Philip,&rsquo; said Marie to her husband, in a supplicating tone, &lsquo;lend
him yours.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Mine!&rsquo; replied the councillor, &lsquo;indeed I cannot; but my late father&rsquo;s is
somewhere upstairs, and I will look it out for you, Waldau.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
Marie blushed at her husband&rsquo;s selfishness. &lsquo;It is old, indeed,&rsquo; said she,
‘but it is large and stout. There is nothing splendid about it, Waldau; it
is simple and useful, like its former possessor; and I beseech you, when
you shall see our brother Maurice, give it to him in my name. It may be
useful to him, notwithstanding its homely appearance; at all events, while
it must recall to Maurice&rsquo;s recollection the memory of his father, it may
also bring him wise reflections.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
She bids him also tell Maurice how much she feels for him, and regrets
that she is unable to offer him any assistance. Waldau wraps himself in
the cloak, and proceeds to Felsenbourg, which he reaches, but not without
being overturned on the road. He is rather hurt by the fall, but not so
much as to prevent his repairing immediately to find Maurice.
</p>
<p>
The evening was somewhat advanced, and the streets of the city, very
different from those of the obscure but peaceful town in which Waldau
dwelt, were crowded still with passengers on horseback and on foot. Waldau
observed directly before him a portico well lighted, over which he saw
inscribed, in large characters, &ldquo;The Palace of Felsenbourg.&rdquo; He entered
with some timidity, and looked around for some one who might direct him in
this vast building, when a young man, passing close by him, attracted his
attention. He was clothed in a court dress, glittering with embroidery,
and held in his hand the hat of a noble, adorned with large white plumes.
The old town-clerk drew himself up hastily, but who can describe his
surprise when he saw, in the half glance which his awe permitted him to
cast upon this person, that he was the banished son, his early friend; in
short, Maurice himself? Waldau was petrified with astonishment: could he
believe his eyes, or did they abuse him? He wished to speak, but the words
died upon his lips; all that he could do was to follow with his eyes this
unexpected figure.
</p>
<p>
When he recovered the use of his faculties, the object who had deprived
him of them, was no longer before him; but he saw him as he withdrew
beneath the shadows of the columns, by the splendour of his garments, the
gems on which glittered beneath the lamps which filled the vault. A little
man dressed in black now approached, and dispelled the ideas which were
bewildering his brain. &lsquo;Will you be so obliging,&rsquo; he said to this person,
‘as to tell me the name of the gentleman who passed us just now?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘It is Mr. Wiesel.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘It is Maurice, then! Good heavens! but tell me what part does he play
here?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘A very important part, Sir: nothing less than that of the prince&rsquo;s
confidant,&rsquo; replied the little man, gravely, and with a low bow.
</p>
<p>
The honest old man is overjoyed, and, without pressing his inquiries any
further, he writes in all haste to the councillor, to inform him of his
brother&rsquo;s good fortune. Upon the receipt of the letter, the elder Wiesel
sets out for Felsenbourg, frightened to death lest Waldau should have
delivered the unkind epistle, which he now wishes he had never written.
Poor Waldau is, in the mean time, suffering from the effects of his fall;
and, on the day following his arrival, he finds himself unable to rise
from his bed. To crown his misfortunes, his money is exhausted; and,
relying upon the generosity of Maurice&rsquo;s temper, and ever doubting that
the prince&rsquo;s confidant is well able to assist him, he writes to him for a
loan, requests an introduction to the minister, and his interest in
procuring the remission of a tax. Maurice hastens to him immediately, and,
after the first congratulations are over, the following conversation
ensues:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
‘To speak seriously, my dear Waldau,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;your request for
money distresses me, because I am not in a situation to comply with it;
but, as to your other request, I have laughed heartily at it. That I
should introduce you to the minister! that I should procure the remission
of a tax! pray, for whom do you take me?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘For whom? Good heaven!&rsquo; replied the old man, cursing in his heart all
courtiers and their impudence; &lsquo;why, for the favorite of his highness, for
his Jonathan, for the elect of the tribe, the <i>primus a rege</i>.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘My poor friend,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;is more ill than I thought; and the joy I
feel at meeting him again, is damped at this discovery. It must be the
fever, dear Waldau, which has thus troubled your judgment.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Waldau, &lsquo;I suppose so; <i>aegria somma?</i> said Waldau
bitterly. &lsquo;It was one of those delusions which a fever works upon sick
brains, that I beheld yesterday traversing the palace of Felsenbourg to go
to the court; it was in a delirium that I beheld him shining in gold and
jewels, <i>gemmis atque auro</i>.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘I, going to the court V &lsquo;You, or who else is the prince&rsquo;s favorite?
</p>
<p>
‘The prince&rsquo;s favorite! Dear Waldau, am I to laugh or to weep at these
extravagances?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘<i>Auri sacra fames</i>, the thirst of wealth will soon render you
incapable of doing either the one or the other.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘How can you thus deceive yourself!&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘He deceived himself too, then&mdash;the little man in black, who followed
the glittering Weisel under the portico of the palace.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Ha, ha, what charming simplicity!&rsquo; cried Maurice, laughing heartily.
‘Still the same honest, excellent, innocent Waldau.&mdash;I a courtier, I
a favourite! this is indeed an everlasting joke. Know, then, my poor
credulous friend, that I am a member of a strolling company who are
engaged to play in the hotel of the Count of Felsenbourg. I played
yesterday the part of the <i>Confidante</i>, in the new piece; and the
little man in black, of whom you speak, is the head tailor, who had just
been fitting me with a coat of scarlet serge, covered with tinsel and
spangles, and to which habit I am indebted for the respect with which you
have overwhelmed me.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘God bless me!&rsquo; cried Waldau, &lsquo;and are you then a player?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘A player, it is true, but of the prince&rsquo;s company; and, I swear to you,
vanity apart, not one of the worst.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Then am I ruined&mdash;totally undone,&rsquo; ejaculated the town-clerk; &lsquo;the
councillor will certainly kill me.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
Maurice ceased to laugh when he saw the terror of Waldau. He soon saw his
brother&rsquo;s letter, which lay upon the table, and, opening it, found not
only that Pierre was still the same, but that his last hope&mdash;the
share of his father&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;was for ever gone. He was burdened
with debts, the payment of which could no longer be postponed. &lsquo;Ah! my
Louisa&mdash;ah, my promised happiness&mdash;farewell,&rsquo; cried he,
mournfully.
</p>
<p>
This Louisa, of whom Maurice spoke, was the preserving angel of an infirm
mother and two sisters, for whom she procured, by her own exertions, the
necessaries of life. The obscure chamber which they occupied was near that
of the player; and they frequently saw each other, and the innocence of
the young girl, her simple candour, and the boyish good temper of Maurice,
soon gave rise to a tender and reciprocal feeling. Poverty has at least
this good effect, that it breaks down some of those obstacles which beset
the more exalted ranks. Wiesel soon became the assiduous and indispensable
friend of the family. Louisa, daily more attracted by his amiable
character, and charmed by the frankness with which he expressed his
affection, did not seek to conceal that she loved him. The deplorable
condition of their fortunes alone stood in the way of their union they
swore eternal constancy, and resolved to wait for better times; but the
letter of Pierre seemed to make that time more distant than ever.
</p>
<p>
Maurice is obliged to quit the sick man to go to the theatre, and an old
woman comes to take his place. The weather is excessively severe, and
Waldau requests him to put on the old cloak which his brother has sent,
and in which, he adds, &lsquo;Your father breathed his last.&rsquo; Maurice seizes it,
and, kissing it respectfully, goes out.
</p>
<p>
The councillor arrives, and, finding from Waldau that his brother has had
his letter, he runs, without waiting for an explanation, to the hotel
Felsenbourg, where the porter, in answer to his inquiries for M. Wiesel,
tells him he is in the theatre. He enters, and is first terrified by
seeing an old man on the stage dressed in the gray cloak of his dead
father; and no sooner has he recovered from his terror than he finds that
his brother is a player. He rushes out of the theatre, half mad with rage.
</p>
<p>
Maurice, in the meantime, has returned to his sick friend, where he finds
his brother&rsquo;s wife, for whom he has a warm affection. Quitting the
chamber, to fetch some medicine from a neighbouring apothecary, he sees an
old woman, who, looking at him very attentively, passes her shrivelled
hand several times over the collar of his coat.
</p>
<p>
Maurice, not quite understanding this familiarity, draws back, and looks
at her attentively. Her thin and colourless features were strangely
contrasted with the benevolent vivacity which seemed to animate them. She
asks him to sell his cloak, and, on his refusal, expresses some surprise
that he can be attached to such a rag.
</p>
<p>
‘No matter,&rsquo; he replies; &lsquo;rag as it is, it is dear to me.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Not for its beauty, surely?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘No; but if you must know, it&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s legacy.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Your father&rsquo;s! Oh, my child, you ought to honour his memory; for no one
can deny that you are his son. Every feature resembles him, excepting that
you have a good-natured sort of smile in the corner of your mouth, which
he never had.
</p>
<p>
‘Oh, yes, he had once, but the world had deprived him of it?&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Say rather, that years had, child; for they do every thing in this world;
and even I, who now talk to you, if I had some few scores of years less,
would you have let me stand here in the snow so long? Oh, no; you would
have whipped this precious cloak over my shoulders.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Go along, you old gipsey; such nymphs are not to my taste.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Well, my son, the frankness of your heart pleases me, and I will reward
it.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Oh, pray keep your rewards: I am not in want of them.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘How naturally that word want comes out of your mouth; and merely because
your head is full of it.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘Who are you, infernal sybil?&rsquo; said Maurice, drawing her towards the
light.
</p>
<p>
‘The sight of my wrinkled face will give you no great pleasure, my child,
but, perhaps, my advice may. Listen to me, then. Go home to your own
chamber, lock the door, and rip up the collar of your cloak, and when you
have done so you will have nothing more to do but to pray to God, as the
great king Solomon did, to grant you wisdom.&rsquo; As she spoke thus, the old
woman hobbled hastily away.
</p>
<p>
Maurice put his hand to the collar of his cloak, and thought he heard a
noise like the rustling of paper. He hastened back to Marie and the town
clerk, and told them of his adventure.
</p>
<p>
‘Just heaven!&rsquo; cried Waldau, &lsquo;it must be so. You remember your late
father, Maurice, and his eternal apprehensions, which all the locks in the
world could not have quieted. You know, too, that he was often obliged to
come to this city for the purpose of receiving large sums of money. What
would a suspicious man do in such a case? He would convert his money, not
into gold, but into paper, because they might easily be concealed.
</p>
<p>
I do not doubt, from the story of the old woman, who has perhaps been his
hostess, his housekeeper, or some faded flower of the mysterious garland
of the past, that this cloak served your father for a strong box. Better
acquainted with handling ducats than a needle, he probably had recourse to
this old woman. You know it was upon his return from a journey that he
died. Marie, open the collar quickly&mdash;Maurice, take my scissors, they
are in my bag&mdash;quick.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
Marie uttered a joyful exclamation, as she felt papers through the fold of
the cloth. At the same moment, a loud noise was heard, and Maurice rose.
</p>
<p>
The unhappy Pierre, upon quitting the theatre in a state of distraction,
had fallen into the canal, and, although he was quickly extricated, he had
only time to mention the place of his abode before he died. The noise was
caused by persons bringing home his corpse. In the confusion which
followed, the cloak, now become so important an object, was stolen, and
all searches and inquiries for its recovery were fruitless.
</p>
<p>
When the first grief for the death of Pierre is over, Maurice finds that
his father&rsquo;s property, which he divides with his brother&rsquo;s widow, is
enough to enable him to marry his Louisa: he returns to Berling, and on
the day fixed for the wedding, on which also Waldau is married to Marie,
the old woman appears at the door in the old cloak. Maurice brings her
into the middle of the room.
</p>
<p>
‘Who are you?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and whence did you get this cloak?&mdash;What
brings you here?&mdash;Quick&mdash;speak&mdash;explain yourself.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘You put a great many questions at once,&rsquo; said the old woman. &lsquo;What brings
me here?&mdash;your good stars. As to the cloak&mdash;it is mine, for I
bought it.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
While she spoke, Maurice looked at her, distrustingly. &lsquo;This old woman,&rsquo; 
said he to himself, &lsquo;has duped me once, and would willingly do so again.
She has found the money in the cloak, and has now come to make a merit of
restoring just so much of it as she thinks fit.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
The old woman seemed to comprehend what was passing in his mind. &lsquo;I see
what you think,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but why, Mr. Giddybrain, did you despise my
advice? why did you so easily abandon this precious cloak? Did I not find
it one fine day hanging up before the shop of my neighbour, the old
clothesman, who told me he bought it of a porter? and what would become of
the bills for twenty thousand florins which are sewed up in it, if I had
not bought them at the exorbitant price of three silver pieces? There,
take your own; keep it more safely for the future, and thank heaven for
having preserved the life of your father&rsquo;s nurse.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
Maurice embraces the old woman, who receives the praises and thanks of
every body present. &lsquo;Well, children,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;since you are all happy,
you must find some little corner among you for me, where I may end my days
in peace.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
‘O, yes!&rsquo; said Marie, with warmth, &lsquo;you shall never quit us.&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>
A few days afterwards you might have thought that the old woman had never
quitted the ancient dwelling, so much did the two families seem to look
upon her as a mother. Their happiness was such as springs from humble
virtue. Piety, innocence, and gentleness, adorned their lives, and their
days had passed in an uniform and peaceable manner, when, about a year
after the return of the old nurse, she appeared one morning before Maurice
in the same attitude as on the day of his marriage, and covered with the
same old cloak. He offered to embrace her, but, repulsing him, &lsquo;Gently,&rsquo; 
said she, &lsquo;take care.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do you bring me another treasure, then, my
good mother?&rsquo; She smiled as she opened the cloak;&mdash;it was a son,
which his Louisa had just given him.

<h2>
A COMICAL ADVENTURE.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s a sort of proëmium to the relation of the following adventure, I must
preadmonish my readers, that I have always entertained a monstrous
aversion to being roused from a comfortable sleep, by the appalling cry of
&ldquo;murder.&rdquo; Heaven defend us! the very thought of such matters, even in
broad day-light, causes a queer sensation about one&rsquo;s throat and fifth
rib: but at the solemn hour of midnight,&mdash;&ldquo;just as the clock strikes
twelve,&rdquo;&mdash;when the winds are howling, and casements creaking, with
all the other paraphernalia of a portentous night (vide &lsquo;Mysteries of
Udolpho&rsquo;)&mdash;oh! it festers up the faculties, and acts as a scare-crow
to the senses. Having premised thus much, and not in the least doubting
that I have touched a sympathetic string in every bosom, I will forthwith
proceed to relate my adventure.
</p>
<p>
Those who have travelled in the north of Scotland, may perchance recollect
the road between Kincardine and Dingwall. On the right, stands a decently
snug tenement, from which a swinging appendage announces to all
peregrinators, that excellent entertainment is there provided for &ldquo;man and
beast.&rdquo; In those parts it was my fortune to be travelling, on a bleak
November evening, with no remarkably near prospect of supper or bed, when
my eyes were suddenly gladdened by the appearance of the afore-mentioned
sign; and so, it appears, were those of my horse, for without receiving
previous notice from me, he instinctively halted at the door. I alighted,
and after a comfortable supper, found myself snugly deposited in bed, next
floor but one to the sky, the other floors being pre-engaged. But scarcely
had gentle sleep diffused its balm over my eyelids, when I was aroused by
a horrible confusion of noises in an adjoining apartment, from which I was
separated only by a slight partition. First, I heard sundry stampings, and
divers violent exclamations; then I plainly distinguished halfstifled
cries of murder, and, at last, the groans of one, as it were, in his last
agony. I was on my feet in the twinkling of an eye, and the reader may
imagine that there was no occasion to make use of my hands in doffing my
night-cap; the first sound of the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; caused that to deposit
itself very quietly on my pillow. My first movement was towards the door,
from which I as quickly retreated, on discovering a murderous-looking
person through the half-opened door of the next apartment; not, however,
before I had uttered a yell loud enough to rouse all the inmates of the
house. I next made towards the window, but there saw nothing, save a
fearful profundity, which, I was well aware, was terminated by a yard,
paved with rough stones.&lsquo;Twas agony.
</p>
<p>
My last resource was the chimney, in which I forthwith proceeded to
enshell myself, taking good care to leave the space of a yard or two
between me and the floor. Scarcely had I thus disposed of myself, when the
landlord entered my apartment, followed by his wife and domestics; whose
voice I no sooner distinguished, than I began very <i>coolly</i> to
descend: but, unfortunately, this being my first attempt at
chimney-sweeping, I made such an unsweeper-like descent, that the landlord
and his train, thinking Old Nick was at hand, scampered off, myself
following with all imaginable speed. Helter-skelter we rushed down the
first flight of stairs; at the bottom of which, finding a door half open,
with a night-capped head protruding, in order, no doubt, to discover the
cause of such a disturbance, we all burglariously entered, knocking down
in our tumultuous incourse, the lawful possessor. There at length the
foremost of our party wheeled to the right about, and the landlady,
discovering me, hastily asked me what was the matter. I explained, as well
as I could, the cause of my alarm; to which explanation, turning up the
whites of her eyes, she replied, half festily, half laughing, &ldquo;Quwhy, Gude
safe us, Sir, &rsquo;twas nae mair than just Sanders Mac Grabbit, ane o&rsquo; the
play-folk, a skirlin the bit tregedy, as he&rsquo;s ganging to play in our barn
like.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; re-answered I; and in less than five minutes my nasal
organ was playing bass to my next door neighbour&rsquo;s treble.

HOW TO MAKE A PAPER.

<h3>
SCENE.&mdash;THE SANCTUM AT THE ESTABLISHMENT IN CATHERINE-STREET, STRAND.
</h3>
<p>
<i>The Editor sitting with his hands in his breeches&rsquo; pockets, leaning
back in his chair, and looking very earnestly at the ceiling. In about ten
minutes he gets up and walks to the window, breathes hard upon the glass,
and flourishes a capital R with his finger in the wet he has made. Looks
at his watch, and rings the Printer&rsquo;s bell. Enter Printer.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. How much matter have you got, Mr. Pica?
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P. (After a pause.)</i> Not more than two columns, Sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. The devil!&mdash;How many ads * can you muster to-day?
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P.</i> Three columns and a half, Sir, including quacks; but I must
use &ldquo;When men of education and professional skill,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Real blessing
to mothers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Have you no standing matter? ** <i>Mr. P</i>. Not a line,
Sir, I used the last of the standing matter yesterday, the account of the
&ldquo;American sea-serpent,&rdquo; which was left out full two months ago, to make
room for the &ldquo;Fire in Fleet-street.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<i>Editor. (Musing.)</i> Very well: I&rsquo;ll touch your bell as soon as I have
any copy ready.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Advertisements.

**  Articles already composed, or in type, but not yet used;
such as good jokes that will keep a week or two&mdash;murders in
America&mdash;or curious discoveries in the East Indies; that
will read as well at Christmas as in the dog-days.
</pre>
<p>
<i>Mr. P.</i> The men are all standing still, Sir, just now If you have
any matter which you intend to use a week hence, they may as well be going
on with it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor. (Rummages among his papers.)</i> Here, take this &ldquo;Romantic
suicide.&rdquo; It will do for any day when you want half a column for the back
page.
</p>
<p>
<i>[Exit Mr. Pica; and a minute after, enter reading boy, in a hurry.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Boy.</i> Copy&mdash;if you please, Sir!
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. I have just given Mr. Pica half a column.
</p>
<p>
<i>Boy</i>. Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon, Sir&mdash;I did not see Mr. Pica&mdash;I
came from down stairs. <i>[Exit.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor: (Puts his hands into his breeches&rsquo; pockets again, and begins to
whistle a tune.)</i> This will not do&mdash;-I must write something&mdash;but
what it is to be about I know no more than the monument. <i>(Nibs his pen&mdash;settles
his inkstand&mdash;and gets his paper ready)</i>. The parliament is up&mdash;the
law courts have adjourned for the long vacation&mdash;the Opera House and
the Winter Theatres have closed&mdash;and at the Haymarket and English
Opera House, they have both brought out pieces which are having a run&mdash;nothing
stirring&mdash;not even a case of decent oppression in a night constable&mdash;or
of tyranny in a police magistrate. Whigs and Tories have shaken hands, and
political delinquencies are too common to be either new or scandalous. The
editor of a daily paper may be aptly compared to a galley slave. When the
winds roar, and the tempest is abroad, and the waves swell, his bark moves
along swiftly; but when the calm comes, and the sky is serene, and the
breeze is hushed, and the sea is smooth, it is then he must ply the oar,
and tug, and pull, and toil, to give the vessel motion.&mdash;<i>( Takes
his pen and writes furiously.)</i> That will do for one of those short
leaders * about nothing&mdash;. which look very much as if they alluded to
something that could not be mentioned, <i>(Reads.)</i>&mdash;&ldquo;There are
certain rumours afloat&mdash;upon a delicate subject which has lately
occasioned a great sensation in particular quarters. We are in possession
of facts connected with this extraordinary affair, which we may perhaps
feel ourselves at liberty to mention in a few days. Meanwhile, all we can
say at present is, that disclosures <i>must</i> take place, however
painful they may be to <i>more than one distinguished</i> individual. We
shall only add, that the Duke of Wellington left town yesterday in his
travelling chariot, with four horses, for Windsor, after a private
interview of nearly three hours with an Illustrious Personage; and that it
is reported his Grace ordered summonses for a cabinet council this day,
before his departure from London. We shall not lose sight of this
business.&rdquo; <i>(Rings the Printer&rsquo;s bell&mdash;Mr. Pica enters.)</i> Make
this the first leader, and you may as well put it in double leads. **
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* &ldquo;Leaders&rdquo;, are those important articles in a paper, which
are printed in large letters, and wherein the editorial <i>We</i>
is supposed to utter oracles <i>de omnibus rebus</i>.

** &ldquo;Double leads&rdquo; is a technical phrase for a mode of
printing which is employed only when an article is either
supposed to be, or is wished to be supposed, super-import-
ant. The lines stand wide apart, and look like the bars of a
gridiron.
</pre>
<p>
<i>Mr. P.</i> Very well, Sir. There&rsquo;s a long police case just come in, of
a baronet&rsquo;s daughter taken up for shoplifting; and an account of the
bursting of a gasometer, which killed eleven men, three boys, and an old
woman, who lived in a front garret over the way.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Use them both, the shop-lifting under the head of
&ldquo;Mysterious Charge of Theft,&rdquo; and the accident to the gasometer under that
of &ldquo;Tremendous Explosion!&mdash;Fifteen Lives Lost!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P.</i> We shall do better with the <i>ads</i>. than I expected.
Robins has just sent a long list of his auctions, which he says must go in
to-morrow; and Kidd&rsquo;s clerk has left eight or ten good book <i>ads.</i>,
so I shall be able to make out a full page without using the quacks. *
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* It is necessary to remark here, by way of explanation,
that there are gradations of rank and respectability in
advertisements; and that a high aristocratical feeling
pervades their location in a well regulated paper. The
<i>quack ads</i>., alluded to by Mr. Pica, are those benevolent
offers of aid to the afflicted, which announce that
&ldquo;rheumatism and lumbago are effectually relieved by a new
process;&rdquo; that the most excruciating toothache is allayed in
one minute by an unrivalled anodyne cement; that &ldquo;gout is
cured without medicine, in a few hours,&rdquo; and &ldquo;blotched faces
in no time at all;&rdquo; that red whiskers are changed in a
single night to beautiful shades of brown or black;&rdquo; that
&ldquo;the healthy functions of the stomach and intestinal canal,
are restored by an improved domestic instrument,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.
These are never allowed to show their faces in the genteel
company of the other advertisements, unless there happens to
be a lack of gentility, but herd together in what is
technically called the, &ldquo;back page&rdquo; of the paper.
</pre>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. So much the better: I abominate &ldquo;Nervous complaints and
debility,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Patent bug destroyer by steam only,&rdquo; side by side with,
&ldquo;Thirty-five thousand pounds wanted&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The daughter of a clergyman&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Books
published this day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>(Exit Printer, laughing at the humourous
vein of the Editor.)</i>&mdash;Well! one leader only: I must write
something else. No Paris papers&mdash;no Dutch mail&mdash;no Flander&rsquo;s
mail&mdash;no German mail&mdash;no mail from Buenos Ayres&mdash;no New
York papers! By-the-bye, it will look like a piece of information to
announce that there is nothing. <i>(Writes.</i>&rsquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;We have seldom
known a day so barren of intelligence of every description. There has not
been a single arrival from the Continent, nor any ship, letters, or papers
from the other side of the Atlantic. Whether this profound calm may be
considered as the harbinger of a coming storm we know not; but when we
remember the ominous complexion of the advices last received from the East
of Europe, and the louring aspect of affairs in general in the
transatlantic hemisphere, it is not unreasonable to conclude that our next
accounts from both quarters will be important. Our readers have not
forgotten the opinion we expressed on Tuesday, and the comprehensive view
we took on Wednesday, of the whole of our political relations. We are
standing, as it were, upon the crater of a volcano, which may break forth
every moment. The attitude of Russia is equivocal&mdash;the intentions of
France are doubtful&mdash;Austria still wears her mask (though we are not
deceived by it)&mdash;while the Peninsula becomes more and more
embarrassing to the great powers of Europe. If we turn our eyes towards
the United States of North America, what do we behold? Alas! this question
needs no answer from us. And if we look at the new republics of South
America, does not the same scene present itself? But we will not pursue
this painful theme. A few hours, in all probability, will put us in
possession of facts that will more than justify all our predictions.&rdquo; <i>(A
knock at the door.)</i> Come in. (Dr. Froth <i>enters</i>.) Froth, how are
you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F</i>. Quite well, at your service, my friend.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> Thank you&mdash;but you may keep your health for yourself,
and your service for your other friends&mdash;you shall not physic me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F.</i> Ha! ha! ha! very good&mdash;you are always brilliant&mdash;any
news to-day?
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Not a syllable, that I have heard&mdash;have you any?
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F. (Looking grave.)</i> The king is very ill!
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F</i>. He is, by Jove! It wont do to mention it, because of the way
in which it came to my ears; but you may depend upon it he is in a very
ticklish situation just now.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. How do you mean? <i>(Dr. F. points to his head, with a very
significant look.)</i> Pooh! I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it! where did you
hear it? <i>(Dr. F. looks round the room, and then whispers in the
Editor&rsquo;s ear.)</i> That should be good authority, but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F</i>. It is a fact, and you&rsquo;ll hear more about it, before long. I
met Mr. Peel on his way to Downing-street as I came here, and he appeared
very agitated. He was walking uncommonly fast, though the day is so hot.
But I&rsquo;ll not interrupt you any longer, for I know your time is precious&mdash;so
good bye. Do you happen to have the Haymarket card disengaged this
evening? And if you <i>could</i> spare me your Vauxhall ticket for next
Friday I should be very much obliged to you. And when you have no <i>other</i>
use for it, I wish you would remember me for Mathews and Yates at the
Adelphi. I have promised Mrs. Froth to take her; and she particularly
desired me to ask you whether you have orders for any of the minor
theatres? She does not care which&mdash;the Cobourg, or the Surrey, or
Astley&rsquo;s&mdash;-but she wants to give our cook a treat before the season
is over.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> My Haymarket card is engaged this evening, I know; but the
English Opera House is at liberty, if that will do.
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F</i>. Thank you, I&rsquo;ll take it&mdash;and perhaps you&rsquo;ll keep the
Haymarket for me to-morrow evening? Can I have Vauxhall on Friday?
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> Yes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. F</i>. You are a fine fellow&mdash;You&rsquo;ll not forget Mathews and
the minors&mdash;Good bye.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> No, no. <i>(Exit Dr. Froth.)</i>&mdash;D&mdash;n these
tickets&mdash;it is half my business every day to remember to whom they
are promised. <i>( Writes. )</i>&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a painful rumour in circulation this morning, in the highest
quarters, upon a subject which is too delicate to mention explicitly. We
hope it may prove altogether unfounded, or at leastmuch exaggerated: but
the peculiar sources, from which we derive our information, justifies us
in attaching more than ordinary weight to the distressing report. Should
any thing further transpire, after our paper is put to press, we shall not
fail to communicate it to our readers in a second edition.&rdquo; <i>(Rings the

<i>Rev. Mr. F.</i> The Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. This is a
letter I received from him this morning, dated only yesterday; and your
paper says, he died suddenly at his Episcopal palace, last Saturday. These
false reports are not only most distressing to the friends and relations
of an individual, but they are cruel disappointments to a numerous class
of your readers. I have met three deans and one prebendary already, who
have hurried up to town in consequence of the scandalous rumour.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. I am really very sorry; but the fact is the rumour did not
originate with us; it was copied from another paper: however I shall be
most happy to give it a positive contradiction.
</p>
<p>
<i>Rev. Mr. F</i>. Sir, I am obliged to you. <i>(The Rev. Judiah Flinn
puts his uncle&rsquo;s letter into his pocket and departs.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor. (Writes.)</i> &ldquo;We cannot sufficiently reprobate the manner in
which some of our contemporaries give circulation to the most unfounded
reports. We, yesterday, incautiously copied from another paper a statement
of the pretended death of the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. We
have the best authority for asserting that this paragraph is wholly
without foundation. We have seen a letter from the Right Reverend prelate,
written four days after the date of his alleged decease, and at which
period he was in the enjoyment of excellent health. We are happy in being
thus enabled to dispel the gloom which the report of his lordship&rsquo;s death
must have occasioned, wherever talents, piety, moral worth, private
virtue, and public integrity are held dear. At any time, the loss of such
a man as the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; would be severely
felt; but at a moment like this, when the best interests of the church are
in danger, it would be a national calamity. In the words of Shakspeare we
are ready to exclaim&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&mdash;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a learned man. May he continue
Long in his country&rsquo;s favour, and do justice
For truth&rsquo;s sake, and his conscience, that his bones,
When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans&rsquo; tears wept on&rsquo;em.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Come, I shall do pretty well for leaders, after all, though there <i>is</i>
nothing to write about. <i>(Rings Mr. Pica&rsquo;s bell.)</i> Here is more copy
ready;&mdash;this is a leader, and this a common <i>par. in l. p.</i> *
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* &ldquo;A common <i>par</i>.&rdquo; is &ldquo;a common paragraph;&rdquo; and &ldquo;l.
p,&rdquo; stands for that description of letter which is called
<i>long primer</i>. Paragraphs, in a paper, have their places of
precedency, and their select company as well as
advertisements. There is as much difference, in point of
dignity and rank, between an l. p. par. (or a paragraph in
large letters), coming immediately after the leaders, and a
scrubby minion par. (or a paragraph in small letter), shoved
any where, as between a minister&rsquo;s private secretary, and
the private secretary&rsquo;s private clerk. Your l. p. par. is a
gentleman, and keeps good society. You will always find him
in the midst of their excellencies the ambassadors, who have
paid visits to the foreign office, or received despatches
from their own governments; side by side with peers and
west-end commoners, who have gone out of town, come into
town or given grand dinners; surrounded with princesses and
other illustrious personages, who have taken an airing or
paid a morning visit. But your minion par. is a sneaking,
shabby, obscure little fellow, poked down in a corner by
himself, or at best, only permitted to associate with
&ldquo;melancholy accidents&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;daring robberies&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;more fires&rdquo;&mdash;
&ldquo;extraordinary longevity&rdquo;&mdash;the puff particular of Warren&rsquo;s
Blacking, and the puffs universal of Colburn&rsquo;s authors. It
is only when parliament is sitting, or there is &ldquo;a press of
matter,&rdquo; that these distinctions are levelled in one common
fate of pars, and even leaders. It is then only, that lords
and ladies, M.P&rsquo;s. and quack doctors, hops, crops, and
concerts, fops, fiddlers, and philosophers, large turnips
and theatrical stars, bishops and burglaries, are all
equally the minions of the daily press, and distinguished
only by their &ldquo;station in the file.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
<i>Mr. P</i>. I have too much already, by at least half a column, and I
don&rsquo;t know what to leave out.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> Half a column too much!&mdash;then you do not want any more
from me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P</i>. No, Sir; I was thinking of keeping the &ldquo;Awful thunder storm&rdquo;
 till to-morrow, only it is a week old already.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Never mind. We shall have some more thunder storms by
to-morrow, in all probability, and then you can put them all together.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P</i>. Do you care about the &ldquo;Grand Seignior&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Flying Fish&rdquo;
 going in to-day? Because, if they are left out, I can make room for the
&ldquo;White Witch,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Persian Ambassador,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waterloo Bridge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<i>Editor</i>. Find a place for the &ldquo;White Witch.&rdquo; She has been standing
for a long time&mdash;ever since Monday.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P</i>. So has &ldquo;Waterloo Bridge,&rdquo; Sir. <i>Editor, (with an arch
look.)</i> Yes, but that was intended to stand.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. P. (laughing.)</i> I shall want two or three small pars., of about
six lines each, to make out the columns, for none of the long articles
will fit exactly.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor.</i> Wait a moment, and I&rsquo;ll give them to you. ( Writes.)&mdash;&ldquo;Mackarel
are just now in season, and remarkably cheap. We are glad of it, for they
furnish an economical and wholesome meal to the poorer classes, with a few
potatoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The metropolis was visited by a violent storm last night. The rain fell
in torrents. We have not heard it extended beyond the immediate vicinity
of London.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If the hot weather continues much longer, there will be too much of it.
The farmers are already crying out sadly for rain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As a man was driving a pig yesterday down the Haymarket, the obstinate
animal ran between the legs of an old woman who was carrying a heavy
basket of cabbages on her head, and threw her down. The poor old creature
bruised her elbow shockingly. The pig ran off in the direction of St.
James&rsquo;s-square. The writer of this saw the accident. What are the
street-keepers about, to allow fellows thus to drive their pigs on the
foot-pavement, in one of the most crowded thoroughfares of the
metropolis?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Anecdote</i>.&mdash;An exquisite, that is, a tiptop dandy, was calling
a coach the other day, opposite Southampton-street in the Strand. The
delicate creature could not make his voice heard; when a rough Jack-tar,
who happened to be passing by, hailed coachee, in a voice like a
speaking-trumpet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Jack, looking unutterable things at the dandy, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s <i>something</i>
wants you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>A Legal Conundrum</i>.&mdash;When a ship of war has but an indifferent
crew, and is ill provided with cannon, she is in want of the assistance of
two learned counsel. Who are they! <i>Man</i>-ning and <i>Gun</i>-ning.&mdash;N.B.
This is not one of Lord Norbury&rsquo;s <i>lasts</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There are half-a-dozen <i>pars</i>, for you. If you do not want them all
to-day, use any of them that will fit, and keep the rest for another time.
</p>
<p>
<i>[Exit Mr. Pica. The Editor puts away his letters and papers&mdash;locks
up his writing-desk&mdash;washes his hands&mdash;adjusts his cravat&mdash;buttons
his coat&mdash;puts on his hat and gloves&mdash;and sallies forth into the
Strand? to enjoy the fresh air, while Mr. Pica is usings all necessary
diligence to get the paper ready for publication.]</i>

<h2>
THE NIGHTMARE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I come in the gleams, from the land of dreams,
Wrapp&rsquo;d round in the midnight&rsquo;s pall;
Ye may hear my moan, in the night-wind&rsquo;s groan,
When the tapestry flaps on the wall;&mdash;
I come from my rest in the death-owl&rsquo;s nest,
Where she screams in fear and pain;
And my wings gleam bright in the wild moonlight,
As it whirls round the madman&rsquo;s brain;
And down sweeps my car, like a falling star,
When the winds have hush&rsquo;d their breath;
When ye feel in the air, from the cold sepulchre,
The faint damp smell of death.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
My vigil I keep, by the murderer&rsquo;s sleep,
When dreams round his senses spin;
And I ride on his breast, and trouble his rest,
In the shape of his deadliest sin;
And hollow and low is his moan of woe
In the depth of his strangling pain,
And his cold black eye rolls in agony,
And faintly rattles his chain.

The sweat-drops fall on the dark prison wall&mdash;
He wakes with a deep-drawn sigh;
He hears my tread, as I pass from his bed,
And he calls on the saints on high.

I fly to the bed where the weary head
Of the poet its rest must seek,
And with false dreams of fame I kindle the flame
Of joy on his pallid cheek.
No thought does he take of the world awake,
And its cold and heartless pleasure,
The holy fire of his own loved lyre
Is his best and dearest treasure.

But neglect&rsquo;s foul sting that cheek shall bring
To a darker and deadlier hue;
The last dear token, his lyre, is broken,
And his heart is broken too.

When the maiden asleep for her lover may weep,
Afar on the boundless sea,
And she dreams he is press&rsquo;d to her welcome breast,
Return&rsquo;d from his dangers free&mdash;
I come in the form of a wave of the storm,
And sweep him away from her heart,
And then in a dream she starts with a scream,
To think that in death they part;
And still in the light of her stream-bound sight
The images whirl and dance,
Till my swift elision dispels the vision,
And she wakes as from a trance.

When the clouds, first-born of the breezy morn,
In the eastern chambers roam,
I glide away in the twilight gray
To rest in my shadowy home;
And darkness and sleep to their kingdom sweep,
And dreams rustle by like a storm;
But where I dwell no man can tell
Who hath seen my hideous form;
Whether it be in the caves of the sea,
Where the rolling breakers go,
Or the crystal sphere of the upper air,
Or the depths of hell below.

<h2>
A GALL-ING SYSTEM.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Dr. Gall first announced his new system of Craniology, the wits of
Paris found it a good subject on which to exercise their talents, and it
was attacked with all the light artillery of jokes and epigrams. Among
others, Mercier, the author of the <i>Tableau de Paris</i>, entered the
lists with his <i>Podology</i> against <i>Craniology</i>, in a squib, in
which he contended, that &ldquo;it is not in the head that ideas reside, nor by
the head that man differs from other animals; that a man without a head
would not on that account, be less reflecting; in short, that the head
says nothing, does nothing, and contributes nothing to the observation of
man. It is his <i>foot</i> which does every thing. It is in the foot that
we must seek and find the stamp of man&rsquo;s original dignity. In the foot?
Yes, Sir, in the foot. Look at the footman, who smiles at your surprise&mdash;is
it not the foot which supports the head? Does not the foot express anger
and indignation? In Spain, all matters of love and gallantry begin with
the foot. The foot, in China, plays the first part. There is nothing more
rude than to tread upon another&rsquo;s foot; when a man gets intoxicated, his
foot refuses to carry him in that state of debasement; in fact, the foot
cannot lie like the mouth and eyes. You must perceive, then, that the foot
has all those qualities which prove a man to be a thinking being, or, in
other words, the foot is the seat of the soul. If you would know,
therefore, whether a woman is tender or faithless, if a man has the
understanding of Montesquieu, or the folly of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
instead of looking at his skull, you must see his foot. Yes, good Dr.
Gall; you shall see my <i>head</i>, and I will examine your feet.&rdquo;&mdash;So
much for the System of craniology.
